Most British newspaper groups have signed up to the programme, under which their articles will appear in a dedicated news section on the site that is due to launch in January. While most Facebook news consumption is currently through links shared on a user’s main newsfeed, the dedicated news tab will involve contractors paid by the social network selecting what they consider to be the main stories of the day from mainstream outlets. In return, publishers are being promised substantial cash sums and the promise of new readers. Facebook declined to comment on the amount of money it is putting into the scheme, but some publishers are privately expecting to make millions of pounds a year from the multi-year deals they have signed with the social network. As a result, news industry sources estimated that the total annual bill for Facebook is likely to run into the tens of millions in the UK alone, making a difference to the finances of struggling news outlets. “It’s an extremely large investment and it’s something we’ve done over multiple years,” said Sarah Brown, Facebook’s head of news partnerships in northern Europe. She said the curators would prioritise checks and balances associated with original reporting when choosing which stories to highlight: “Is it deeply sourced reporting, is it timely, is it offering an interesting angle, is it well sourced?” The Facebook News section will feature a mix of top stories chosen by curators employed by the news aggregator service Upday, alongside other stories chosen algorithmically to reflect a user’s interests. The outlets that have signed up to be launch partners include the Guardian, the Daily Mirror, the Independent, all the UK’s major regional news publishers, and magazines such as the Economist. Facebook said it hoped to add further publishers to the deal. Other news sites that have not agreed deals with Facebook, including hyperlocal sites, may still appear in the section if they meet certain criteria on standards.

          "body": "<h2>Adarsh Ambati, 15, San Jose, California</h2> <p>I started getting interested in coding when I was about 11. I joined a local community lab where biologists and computer scientists come together and conduct experiments. I wanted to join the lab because my brother was really into biology and at the time I wanted to be exactly like him. I was too young to participate in the experiments, so my mentor pushed me more towards coding.</p> <p>Then a couple of years ago my mum had a third-degree heart block and had to go to hospital where she was hooked up to so many different wires to monitor her health. But the wires ended up hindering her health because they stopped her moving around. I wanted to make something that could help her and other people feel better by having their mobility restored, while still being able to monitor their vital signs.</p> <p>That’s when I came up with an idea for a contactless vital signs monitor. It took me around nine months to develop the device and build an app with notifications so doctors could use it, but also regular people. Because it’s contactless and relatively portable it could even be used to detect infectious diseases such as Covid-19. My mum got better before I finished the project, so unfortunately I couldn’t use it on her, but I did test it on a lot of other people. I had 40 participants in my pilot study and did over 1,000 tests.</p> <p>In the past, coders have been thought of as nerds and social pariahs, but technology has become a lot more interactive and social than it used to be.</p> <p>At school there are a lot of kids who are really interested in computer science. I think about 25% of people want to pursue it in some way as a career. A lot of young people now associate tech with the sleek, beautiful campuses of Apple and Facebook in Silicon Valley.</p> <p>I made my monitor because I saw a problem with my mum’s heart, but I also did a project about an eco- sprinkler system when I saw that a lot of water was wasted on my neighbours’ lawns. I want to combine my passions of environmental science and computer science and build a product that will make conservational biology much more efficient. Preserving biodiversity is something we’re struggling with as a planet; hopefully one day I can develop a device that can make that go more smoothly.</p> <h2>Raphaël Wreford, 13, London</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56c6b636f7b1f1e2cea774181d92242d76c3a10a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56c6b636f7b1f1e2cea774181d92242d76c3a10a/189_772_5511_3307/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Raphael Wreford, 13,at his computer at home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Screen time: Raphaël Wreford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My technology career started when I was four and my dad showed me how to make a PowerPoint. I was really bad at drawing, so I would use it to make cool shapes and animations. I began making one every week about the most boring subjects, like my house, and presenting them to my primary school class. I think I started a trend because so many people started doing it after that.</p> <p>Soon after, my friend’s dad, who made video games, realised I was interested in computers and started teaching me about coding. He showed us the things he had made and I was fascinated because I realised with code you could make anything you want. I would play around with an old spare computer at home and mash the keys, hoping it would produce a good output – that’s how I lost my first computer to a million viruses.</p> <p>Initially, I only wanted to learn code so I could make my own video games. My parents were quite strict with technology. I didn’t have a games console and I knew if I asked to play video games, most of the time the answer would be no. But if I asked to make one, they would let me because it was educational. It was a great way of bypassing the rules.</p> <p>For about three years my friend and I used the library computer at school to work on game ideas. My first creation was very boring – and my family definitely expressed that. I really wanted to do something unique and helpful. I had an idea to make a video game for blind people. I always knew the game should be shaped around sounds, so a blind person could hear it. I spent a whole summer talking to my dad about it and when I started making it, it ran really smoothly.</p> <p>I want to make it available on Android game apps soon and eventually add some of the adverts that allow you to get paid a little. Once you’ve got the skills it’s quite easy to make money from coding – even when you’re just 13.</p> <p>I think 20 years ago coding seemed like a geeky thing to do, but now you have drones that rescue people in mountains, robot surgeons and AI that is a million times smarter than humans. Young people are realising they can save the world with code.</p> <h2>Fiona Geary, 13, West Cork</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa3d621a9baa3712aba4d6f3368c66e35dc83459\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa3d621a9baa3712aba4d6f3368c66e35dc83459/0_130_3888_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fíona Geary at her computer at home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Game changer: Fíona Geary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the Geary family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When I was seven my parents saw things on the TV about coding and took me to a local coding club. I liked that you could write a set of instructions to the computer and it carried out your wishes: you could create any idea that popped up in your head. I started experimenting with mini-games. I made one where you had to save an alien planet from climate change. We always get lectures about climate change and I wanted to create a fun game with aliens to do a unique spin on the concept. </p> <p>When I was 12, I made an animation about a refugee who travels to Ireland from Syria. I had heard about it so much in the news and I wanted to use my skills to get the message out there because people my age might not know about these things.</p> <p>My current project is a website about mindfulness, the name is <a href=\"https://codepen.io/bluelion7/full/YzPdxLV?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=bddf5bf4e96e9acd41ff6f96d6d84c4bdab61e55-1605598408-0-AY1EElUXA871vcvBX6xou6Cg_OIbQ699E0uj4h6Dz6ZWS5NASAIkWr8NmL83abmKrl-trxHvNURsQXHPEEXeLdJbNYQLaPXzOF95JBnmxV8yv9eqRt059cmmIKDQs8WHy95YPZqqBtLb6Bb7k7RsQ0G8KzdaAPWJs7vfqq1tv_xLDCaGLwYdqwnqqnnMVnRKYrLfXmx1dWZVReUnZd4VFwOl34IQDlocduCLLOxrebBWULYpNl3NumZLDbsVWTUKYzezEGASLrkpR9P-GPvpAo8d_xFtpg9RuYtRShsvY9D8laUVm4SDCwPht8HX4mbBxiLNER3WlwIAz7nXzHuJOYq90koppq0Iqybj7BXb2a4W\" title=\"\">TeenBeo</a> – <em>beo</em> is the Irish word for life. I think that every young person can get nervous sometimes and growing up in 2020 there is a lot of chaos with social media and living up to certain ideals. There are notifications coming at you all the time. The internet can be very hectic. That’s why it’s important to take a break sometimes. On my website there’s a stress ball you can click on when you are angry, there’s music, there’s a breathing exercise, there’s also an area where you can write down all your worries.</p> <p>I haven’t shown it to my friends yet as I was keeping it a bit of a secret until I was comfortable with it. If I do put it up publicly, people could share their artwork and recordings on there. I don’t think there’s anywhere in life that so many people can come together as a community like the internet.</p> <p>A lot of teenagers don’t get into coding, which is a shame, because it’s very helpful. It’s way harder to connect with people without technology – without it lockdown would have been a disaster: no online meetings, no online school, we would have basically done nothing the whole time. It’s hard to imagine a world without tech. I guess you would have to have a power cut to know what it’s like.</p> <p>At the moment I’m dreaming of learning JavaScript and maybe some Python as well, and I would also love to program a robot. That would be really cool. Eventually, I’d like to work somewhere like Google, especially with all the slides, but I’m only 13 so I’m keeping my options open.</p> <h2>Elana Monaghan, 16, and Saibh Malcolm, 15, Galway</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59da9a9a535844ed3eec8ee225069054ab581213\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59da9a9a535844ed3eec8ee225069054ab581213/0_57_919_551/500.jpg\" alt=\"Elana Monaghan and Saibh Malcom in their school uniform at school\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Class act: Elana Monaghan and Saibh Malcolm</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Elana: </strong>You can do anything with code; you can make an app or a website about anything, whether that’s about books or design. We’re both pretty creative and I think that’s one of the things that attracted us to code.</p> <p><strong>Saibh:</strong> For me the problem-solving side very appeals as well. There is so much to actually coding a website and there is always something more to learn. If you are creative, finding something that you can use your imagination with is so cool. You can think of anything and then go ahead and make it into something.</p> <p><strong>E:</strong> In Ireland, you get a choice of a few schools in your area and when it came to picking secondary schools I picked the one that was most convenient, but last year I transferred to Saibh’s school and now I’m much happier. After that experience, we came up with an idea for an app called <a href=\"https://twitter.com/exploringschool?lang=en\" title=\"\">Exploring Schools</a>, to help primary school kids choose the right secondary school for them.</p> <p><strong>S:</strong> If I was still in primary school and had the app, I would definitely look at the number of people in the school: my primary school had about 40 students, and then I moved to a secondary school that had more than 800 students – and that was a big change.</p> <p><strong>E:</strong> Our app evolved as we got more focused and started getting the information together – that was definitely the longest part. There are 47 schools in Galway and we had to go through every school’s details.</p> <p><strong>S: </strong>We talked to our friends’ younger brothers and sisters and they all said they thought it would be really helpful. Most of the schools have their own websites, but they’re hard to navigate and find the information that you want. We want to help kids compare schools and have all the information in one place so they make the right choice.</p> <p><strong>E: </strong>We definitely want to expand the app. At the moment we only have it for one county in Ireland, but we’re hoping to have it for all of Ireland soon. We probably have to find a more efficient way of collecting the information – at the moment we’re just Googling the schools one by one.</p> <p><strong>S:</strong> Coding still isn’t very big, especially among girls, but I think people are definitely getting more into it. In our school we’re probably the only two people who are really into coding, but it’s becoming more popular.</p> <p><strong>E:</strong> In 10 years’ time everyone will want to learn how to code. It will definitely help us in the future.</p> <h2>Nico Papamichael, 13, London</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54138d66089f232eb7f12d4822549a3db28f71f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54138d66089f232eb7f12d4822549a3db28f71f8/0_208_6240_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nico Papamichael, 13, London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bright spark: Nico Papamichael.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are so many things you can do with coding, it’s fun to explore and see what you can create. I enjoy trying things and seeing if it works – if it doesn’t, I try it a different way.</p> <p>I’ve always been interested in things like computers, phones and technology, so I saved up and bought myself a couple of computers – I don’t spend my money on anything else, really. I started playing around with programming. I like to experiment with things that already exist. For example, I used to go to a swimming pool and they had contactless key cards that they gave us. When I stopped going I decided to reprogram the card so that I could tap it on to my iPhone and it would turn the flashlight on. It was pretty useful, actually.</p> <p>I also spend more time messing around with video games than I spend actually playing them. I like to see how a game is written and do something with it that makes it easier to play or makes you invincible. I made a new world on MineCraft where I changed the icon and I changed how many points I had – you can change the colours and characters until it’s basically a new world. Once you know how to do it, it’s not really very hard. I’m just really interested in how I can improve things and make them more interesting.</p> <p>I find it quite surprising that no one I know really enjoys doing the things that I do. We go to digital literacy classes at school, which is basically IT, and we learn coding. I tend to get through it in 10 minutes instead of an hour and then I just make my own stuff up. Everyone always asks me for help all the time. I think it’s because I see it as a hobby rather than a lesson that I have to do. They don’t see it as that much fun.</p> <p>Code is like a language; once you learn it from the beginning you can only learn it more and more and more. One day, when I’m really good at it my plan is to create something that no one has ever made – I want to come up with a computer that no one has ever seen before. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for the Design Review newsletter to get a monthly dose of creative inspiration\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/design-review\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Design Review\" data-form-description=\"Get  a monthly dose of creative inspiration\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up.

It was a great way of bypassing the rules. For about three years my friend and I used the library computer at school to work on game ideas. My first creation was very boring – and my family definitely expressed that. I really wanted to do something unique and helpful. I had an idea to make a video game for blind people. I always knew the game should be shaped around sounds, so a blind person could hear it. I spent a whole summer talking to my dad about it and when I started making it, it ran really smoothly. I want to make it available on Android game apps soon and eventually add some of the adverts that allow you to get paid a little. Once you’ve got the skills it’s quite easy to make money from coding – even when you’re just 13. I think 20 years ago coding seemed like a geeky thing to do, but now you have drones that rescue people in mountains, robot surgeons and AI that is a million times smarter than humans. Young people are realising they can save the world with code. Fiona Geary, 13, West Cork When I was seven my parents saw things on the TV about coding and took me to a local coding club. I liked that you could write a set of instructions to the computer and it carried out your wishes: you could create any idea that popped up in your head. I started experimenting with mini-games. I made one where you had to save an alien planet from climate change. We always get lectures about climate change and I wanted to create a fun game with aliens to do a unique spin on the concept. When I was 12, I made an animation about a refugee who travels to Ireland from Syria. I had heard about it so much in the news and I wanted to use my skills to get the message out there because people my age might not know about these things. My current project is a website about mindfulness, the name is TeenBeo – beo is the Irish word for life. I think that every young person can get nervous sometimes and growing up in 2020 there is a lot of chaos with social media and living up to certain ideals. There are notifications coming at you all the time. The internet can be very hectic. That’s why it’s important to take a break sometimes. On my website there’s a stress ball you can click on when you are angry, there’s music, there’s a breathing exercise, there’s also an area where you can write down all your worries. I haven’t shown it to my friends yet as I was keeping it a bit of a secret until I was comfortable with it. If I do put it up publicly, people could share their artwork and recordings on there. I don’t think there’s anywhere in life that so many people can come together as a community like the internet. A lot of teenagers don’t get into coding, which is a shame, because it’s very helpful. It’s way harder to connect with people without technology – without it lockdown would have been a disaster: no online meetings, no online school, we would have basically done nothing the whole time. It’s hard to imagine a world without tech. I guess you would have to have a power cut to know what it’s like. At the moment I’m dreaming of learning JavaScript and maybe some Python as well, and I would also love to program a robot. That would be really cool. Eventually, I’d like to work somewhere like Google, especially with all the slides, but I’m only 13 so I’m keeping my options open. Elana Monaghan, 16, and Saibh Malcolm, 15, Galway Elana: You can do anything with code; you can make an app or a website about anything, whether that’s about books or design. We’re both pretty creative and I think that’s one of the things that attracted us to code. Saibh: For me the problem-solving side very appeals as well. There is so much to actually coding a website and there is always something more to learn. If you are creative, finding something that you can use your imagination with is so cool. You can think of anything and then go ahead and make it into something. E: In Ireland, you get a choice of a few schools in your area and when it came to picking secondary schools I picked the one that was most convenient, but last year I transferred to Saibh’s school and now I’m much happier. After that experience, we came up with an idea for an app called Exploring Schools, to help primary school kids choose the right secondary school for them. S: If I was still in primary school and had the app, I would definitely look at the number of people in the school: my primary school had about 40 students, and then I moved to a secondary school that had more than 800 students – and that was a big change. E: Our app evolved as we got more focused and started getting the information together – that was definitely the longest part. There are 47 schools in Galway and we had to go through every school’s details. S: We talked to our friends’ younger brothers and sisters and they all said they thought it would be really helpful. Most of the schools have their own websites, but they’re hard to navigate and find the information that you want. We want to help kids compare schools and have all the information in one place so they make the right choice. E: We definitely want to expand the app. At the moment we only have it for one county in Ireland, but we’re hoping to have it for all of Ireland soon. We probably have to find a more efficient way of collecting the information – at the moment we’re just Googling the schools one by one. S: Coding still isn’t very big, especially among girls, but I think people are definitely getting more into it. In our school we’re probably the only two people who are really into coding, but it’s becoming more popular. E: In 10 years’ time everyone will want to learn how to code. It will definitely help us in the future. Nico Papamichael, 13, London There are so many things you can do with coding, it’s fun to explore and see what you can create. I enjoy trying things and seeing if it works – if it doesn’t, I try it a different way. I’ve always been interested in things like computers, phones and technology, so I saved up and bought myself a couple of computers – I don’t spend my money on anything else, really. I started playing around with programming. I like to experiment with things that already exist. For example, I used to go to a swimming pool and they had contactless key cards that they gave us. When I stopped going I decided to reprogram the card so that I could tap it on to my iPhone and it would turn the flashlight on. It was pretty useful, actually. I also spend more time messing around with video games than I spend actually playing them. I like to see how a game is written and do something with it that makes it easier to play or makes you invincible. I made a new world on MineCraft where I changed the icon and I changed how many points I had – you can change the colours and characters until it’s basically a new world. Once you know how to do it, it’s not really very hard. I’m just really interested in how I can improve things and make them more interesting. I find it quite surprising that no one I know really enjoys doing the things that I do. We go to digital literacy classes at school, which is basically IT, and we learn coding. I tend to get through it in 10 minutes instead of an hour and then I just make my own stuff up. Everyone always asks me for help all the time. I think it’s because I see it as a hobby rather than a lesson that I have to do. They don’t see it as that much fun. Code is like a language; once you learn it from the beginning you can only learn it more and more and more. One day, when I’m really good at it my plan is to create something that no one has ever made – I want to come up with a computer that no one has ever seen before.",

          "bodyText": "A new tech regulator will work to limit the power of Google, Facebook and other tech platforms, the government has announced, in an effort to ensure a level playing field for smaller competitors and a fair market for consumers. Under the plans, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will gain a dedicated Digital Markets Unit, empowered to write and enforce a new code of practice on technology companies which will set out the limits of acceptable behaviour. The code will only affect those companies deemed to have “strategic market status”, though it has not yet been decided what that means, nor what restrictions will be imposed. The business secretary, Alok Sharma, said: “Digital platforms like Google and Facebook make a significant contribution to our economy and play a massive role in our day-to-day lives – whether it’s helping us stay in touch with our loved ones, share creative content or access the latest news. “But the dominance of just a few big tech companies is leading to less innovation, higher advertising prices and less choice and control for consumers.

The basic assumption that we can track the movement of people by tracking their phones is an accepted fact.</p> <p>This year has been good for tech companies, and Apple is no exception. The wave of global lockdowns has left us more reliant than ever on our devices. Despite being one of the first large companies to be seriously affected by Covid, as factory shutdowns in China hit its supply chain delaying the launch of the iPhone 12 by a month, Apple’s revenue has continued to break records. It remains the largest publicly traded company in the world by a huge margin: this year its value has grown by 50% to $2tn (£1.5tn) and it is still $400bn larger than Microsoft, the No 2.</p> <p>It’s hard to think of another product that has come close to the iPhone in sheer physical proximity to our daily lives. Our spectacles, contact lenses and implanted medical devices are among the only things more personal than our phones.</p> <p>Without us even noticing, Apple has turned us into organisms living symbiotically with technology: part human, part machine.<strong> </strong>We now outsource our contact books, calendars and to-do lists to devices. We no longer need to remember basic facts about the world; we can call them up on demand. But if you think that carrying around a smartphone – or wearing an Apple Watch that tracks your vitals in real time – isn’t enough to turn you into a cyborg, you may feel differently about what the company has planned next.</p> <p>A pair of smartglasses, in development for a decade, could be released as soon as 2022, and would have us quite literally seeing the world through Apple’s lens – putting a digital layer between us and the world. Already, activists are worrying about the privacy concerns sparked by a camera on everyone’s face. But deeper questions, about what our relationship should be to a technology that mediates our every interaction with the world, may not even be asked until it’s too late to do anything about the answer.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The word cyborg – short for “cybernetic organism” – <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/09/the-man-who-first-said-cyborg-50-years-later/63821/\">was coined in 1960 by Manfred E Clynes and Nathan S Kline</a>, whose research into spaceflight prompted them to explore how incorporating mechanical components could aid in “the task of adapting man’s body to any environment he might choose”. It was a very medicalised concept: the pair imagined embedded pumps dispensing drugs automatically.</p> <p>In the 1980s, genres such as cyberpunk began to express writers’ fascination with the nascent internet, and wonder how much further it could go. “It was the best we could do at the time,” laughs Bruce Sterling, a US science fiction author and futurist whose Mirrorshades anthology defined the genre for many. Ideas about putting computer chips, machine arms or chromium teeth into animals might have been very cyberpunk, Sterling says, but they didn’t really work. Such implants, he points out, aren’t “biocompatible”. Organic tissue reacts poorly, forming scar tissue, or worse, at the interface. While science fiction pursued a Matrix-style vision of metal jacks embedded in soft flesh, reality took a different path.</p> <p>“If you’re looking at cyborgs in 2020,” Sterling says, “it’s in the Apple Watch. It’s already a medical monitor, it’s got all these health apps. If you really want to mess with the inside of your body, the watch lets you monitor it much better than anything else.”</p> <p>The Apple Watch had a shaky start. Despite the company trying to sell it as the second coming of the iPhone, early adopters were more interested in using their new accessory as a fitness tracker than in trying to send a text message from a device far too small to fit a keyboard. So by the second iteration of the watch, Apple changed tack, leaning into the health and fitness aspect of the tech.</p> <p>Now, your watch can not only measure your heart rate, but scan the electric signals in your body for evidence of arrhythmia; it can measure your blood oxygenation level, warn you if you’re in a noisy environment that could damage your hearing, and even call 999 if you fall over and don’t get up. It can also, like many consumer devices, track your running, swimming, weightlifting or dancercise activity. And, of course, it still puts your emails on your wrist, until you turn that off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bbc7fcf1d5e561555810f916908283daa8c9d7fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbc7fcf1d5e561555810f916908283daa8c9d7fc/0_0_5315_3543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apple believes that it can succeed where Google Glass failed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apple believes that it can succeed where Google Glass failed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Steven Gregor/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Sterling points out, for a vast array of health services that we would once have viewed as science fiction, there’s no need for an implanted chip in our head when an expensive watch on our wrist will do just as well.</p> <p>That’s not to say that the entirety of the cyberpunk vision has been left to the world of fiction. There really are people walking around with robot limbs, after all. And even there, Apple’s influence has starkly affected what that future looks like.</p> <p>“Apple, I think more than any other brand, truly cares about the user experience. And they test and test and test, and iterate and iterate and iterate. And this is what we’ve taken from them,” says Samantha Payne, the chief operating officer of Bristol’s <a href=\"https://openbionics.com/\">Open Bionics</a>. The company, which she co-founded in 2014 with CEO Joel Gibbard, makes the Hero Arm, a multi-grip bionic hand. With the rapid development of 3D printer technology, Open Bionics has managed to slash the cost of such advanced prosthetics, which could have cost almost $100,000 10 years ago, to just a few thousand dollars.</p> <p>Rather than focus on flesh tones and lifelike design, Open Bionics leans into the cyborg imagery. Payne quotes one user describing it as “unapologetically bionic”. “All of the other prosthetics<strong> </strong>companies give the impression that you should be trying to hide your disability, that you need to try and fit in,” she says. “We are company that’s taking a big stance against that.”</p> <p>At times, Open Bionics has been almost too successful in that goal. In November, the company launched an arm designed to look like that worn by the main character in the video game Metal Gear Solid V <strong>–</strong><strong> </strong>red and black, shiny plastic and, yes, unapologetically bionic<strong> – </strong>and the response was unsettling. “You got loads of science fiction fans saying that they really are considering chopping off their hand,” Payne says.</p> <p>Some disabled people who rely on technology to live their daily lives feel that cyberpunk imagery can exoticise the very real difficulties they face. And there are also lessons in the way that more prosaic devices can give disabled people what can only be described as superpowers. Take hearing aid users, for example: deaf iPhone owners can not only connect their hearing aids to their phones with Bluetooth, they can even set up their phone as a microphone and move it closer to the person they want to listen to, overcoming the noise of a busy restaurant or crowded lecture theatre. Bionic ears anyone?</p> <p>“There’s definitely something in the idea of everyone in the world being a cyborg today,” Payne says. “A crazy high number of people in the world have a smartphone, and so all of these people are technologically augmented. It’s definitely taking it a step further when you depend on that technology to be able to perform everyday living; when it’s adorned to your body. But we are all harnessing the vast power of the internet every single day.”</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Making devices so compelling that we carry them with us everywhere we go is a mixed blessing for Apple. The iPhone earns it about $150bn a year, more than every other source of revenue combined. In creating the iOS App Store, it has assumed a gatekeeper role with the power to reshape entire industries by carefully defining its terms of service. (Ever wonder why every app is asking for a subscription these days? <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/6/8/11880730/apple-app-store-subscription-update-phil-schiller-interview\">Because of an Apple decision in 2016</a>. Bad luck if you prefer to pay upfront for software.) But it has also opened itself up to criticism that the company allows, or even encourages, compulsive patterns of behaviour.</p> <p>Apple co-founder Steve Jobs famously likened personal computers to “bicycles for the mind”, enabling people to do more work for the same amount of effort. That was true of the Macintosh computer in 1984, but modern smartphones are many times more powerful. If we now turn to them every waking hour of the day, is that because of their usefulness, or for more pernicious reasons?</p> <p>“We don’t want people using their phones all the time,” Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, said in 2019. “We’re not motivated to do that from a business point of view, and we’re certainly not from a values point of view.” <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/apple-tim-cook-interview-wwdc-2019-cbs-news-exclusive/\">Later that year, Cook told CBS</a>: “We made the phone to make your life better, and everybody has to decide for his or herself what that means. For me, my simple rule is if I’m looking at the device more than I’m looking into someone’s eyes, I’m doing the wrong thing.”</p> <p>Apple has introduced features, such as the Screen Time setting, that help people strike that balance: users can now track, and limit, their use of individual apps, or entire categories, as they see fit. Part of the problem is that, while Apple makes the phone, it doesn’t control what people do with it. Facebook needs users to open its app daily, and Apple can only do so much to counter that tendency. If these debates – about screen time, privacy and what companies are doing with our data, our attention – seem like a niche topic of interest now, they will become crucial once Apple’s latest plans become reality. The reason is the company’s worst-kept secret in years: a pair of smartglasses.</p> <p>It <a href=\"https://www.freepatentsonline.com/8212859.html\">filed a patent in 2006</a> for a rudimentary version, a headset that would let users see a “peripheral light element” for an “enhanced viewing experience”, able to display notifications in the corner of your vision. That was finally granted in 2013, at the time of Google’s own attempt to convince people about smartglasses. But Google Glass failed commercially, and Apple kept quiet about its intentions in the field.</p> <p>Recently, the company has intensified its focus on “augmented reality”, technology that overlays a virtual world on the real one. It’s perhaps best known through the video game Pokémon Go, which launched in 2016, superimposing Nintendo’s cute characters on parks, offices and playgrounds. However, Apple insists, it has much greater potential than simply enhancing games.<strong> </strong>Navigation apps could overlay the directions on top of the real world; shopping services could show you what you would look like wearing the clothes you’re thinking of getting; architects could walk around inside the spaces they have designed before shovels even break ground.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"150f95cce4d799d0a7f4c7398a46203dd2cc130e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/150f95cce4d799d0a7f4c7398a46203dd2cc130e/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Smartglasses could leave us quite literally seeing the world through Apple’s lens.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smartglasses could leave us quite literally seeing the world through Apple’s lens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Steven Gregor/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With each new iPhone launch, Apple’s demonstrated new breakthroughs in the technology, such as “Lidar” support in new iPhones and iPads, a tech (think radar with lasers) that lets them accurately measure the physical space they are in. Then, at the end of 2019, it all slotted into place: a Bloomberg report suggested that the company hadn’t given up on smartglasses in the wake of Google Glass’s failure, but had spent five years honing the concept. The pandemic put paid to a target of <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-21/why-2020-is-looking-great-for-apple-products-and-consumer-gadgets\">getting hardware on the shelves in 2020</a>, but the company is still hoping to make an announcement next year for a 2022 launch, Bloomberg suggested.</p> <p>Apple’s plans cover two devices, codenamed N301 and N421. The former is designed to feature “ultra-high-resolution screens that will make it almost impossible for a user to differentiate the virtual world from the real one”, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. This is a product with an appeal far beyond the hardcore gamers who have adopted existing VR headsets: you might put it on to enjoy lifelike, immersive entertainment, or to do creative work that can make the most of the technology, but would probably take it off to have lunch, for instance.</p> <p>N421 is where the real ambitions lie. Expected in 2023, it’s described only as “a lightweight pair of glasses using AR”. But, argues Mark Pesce in his book Augmented Reality, this would be the culmination of the “mirrorshades” dreamed up by the cyberpunks in the 80s, using the iPhone as the brains of the device and “keeping the displays themselves light and comfortable”.<strong> </strong>Wearing it all day, every day, the idea of a world without a digital layer between you and reality would eventually fade into memory – just as living without immediate access to the internet has for so many right now.</p> <p>Apple isn’t the first to try to build such a device, says Rupantar Guha of the analysts GlobalData, who has been following the trend in smartglasses from a business standpoint for years, but it could lead the wave that makes it relevant. “The public perception of smartglasses has struggled to recover from the high-profile failure of Google Glass, but big tech still sees potential in the technology.” Guha cites the recent launch of Amazon Echo Frames – sunglasses you can talk to, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/20/amazon-alexa-smartglasses-google-glass-snapchat-spectacles-voice-assistant\">because they have got the Alexa digital assistant built in</a> – and Google’s purchase of the smartglasses maker North in June 2020. “Apple and Facebook are planning to launch consumer smartglasses over the next two years, and will expect to succeed where their predecessors could not,” Guha adds.</p> <p>If Apple pulls off that launch, then the cyberpunk – and cyborg – future will have arrived. It’s not hard to imagine the concerns, as cultural questions clash with technological: should kids take off their glasses in the classroom, just as we now require them to keep phones in their lockers? Will we need to carve out lens-free time in our evenings to enjoy old-fashioned, healthy activities such as watching TV or playing video games? </p> <p>“It’s a fool’s errand to imagine every use of AR before we have the hardware in our hands,” <a href=\"https://mssv.net/2020/08/16/digital-sight-management-and-the-mystery-of-the-missing-amazon-receipts/?utm_source=Benedict%27s+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=6d659b4b5a-Benedict%27s+newsletter+free&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_4999ca107f-6d659b4b5a-70378189\">writes the developer Adrian Hon</a>, who was called on by Google to write games for their smartglasses a decade ago.<strong> </strong>“Yet there’s one use of AR glasses that few are talking about but will be world-changing: scraping data from everything we see.” This “worldscraping” would be a big tech dream – and a privacy activist’s nightmare. A pair of smartglasses turns people into walking CCTV cameras, and the data that a canny company could gather from that is mindboggling. Every time someone browsed a supermarket, their smartglasses would be recording real-time pricing data, stock levels and browsing habits; every time they opened up a newspaper, their glasses would know which stories they read, which adverts they looked at and which celebrity beach pictures their gaze lingered on.</p> <p>“We won’t be able to opt out from wearing AR glasses in 2035 any more than we can opt out of owning smartphones today,” Hon writes. “Billions have no choice but to use them for basic tasks like education, banking, communication and accessing government services. In just a few years time, AR glasses do the same, but faster and better.”</p> <p>Apple would argue that, if any company is to control such a powerful technology, it ought to. The company declined to speak on the record for this story, but it has invested time and money in making the case that it can be trusted not to abuse its power. The company points to its comparatively simple business model: make things, and sell them for a lot of money. It isn’t Google or Facebook, trying to monetise personal data, or Amazon, trying to replace the high street – it’s just a company that happens to make a £1,000 phone that it can sell to 150 million people a year.</p> <p>But whether we trust Apple might be beside the point, if we don’t yet know whether we can trust ourselves. It took eight years from the launch of the iPhone for screen time controls to follow. What will human interaction look like eight years after smartglasses become ubiquitous? Our cyborg present sneaked up on us as our phones became glued to our hands. Are we going to sleepwalk into our cyborg future in the same way?</p>",

          "bodyText": "At the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, Apple engineers embarked on a rare collaboration with Google. The goal was to build a system that could track individual interactions across an entire population, in an effort to get a head start on isolating potentially infectious carriers of a disease that, as the world was discovering, could be spread by asymptomatic patients. Delivered at breakneck pace, the resulting exposure notification tool has yet to prove its worth. The NHS Covid-19 app uses it, as do others around the world. But lockdowns make interactions rare, limiting the tool’s usefulness, while in a country with uncontrolled spread, it isn’t powerful enough to keep the R number low. In the Goldilocks zone, when conditions are just right, it could save lives. The NHS Covid-19 app has had its teething problems. It has come under fire for not working on older phones, and for its effect on battery life. But there’s one criticism that has failed to materialise: what happens if you leave home without your phone? Because who does that?

That’s not to say that the entirety of the cyberpunk vision has been left to the world of fiction. There really are people walking around with robot limbs, after all.

Apple isn’t the first to try to build such a device, says Rupantar Guha of the analysts GlobalData, who has been following the trend in smartglasses from a business standpoint for years, but it could lead the wave that makes it relevant. “The public perception of smartglasses has struggled to recover from the high-profile failure of Google Glass, but big tech still sees potential in the technology.” Guha cites the recent launch of Amazon Echo Frames – sunglasses you can talk to, because they have got the Alexa digital assistant built in – and Google’s purchase of the smartglasses maker North in June 2020. “Apple and Facebook are planning to launch consumer smartglasses over the next two years, and will expect to succeed where their predecessors could not,” Guha adds. If Apple pulls off that launch, then the cyberpunk – and cyborg – future will have arrived. It’s not hard to imagine the concerns, as cultural questions clash with technological: should kids take off their glasses in the classroom, just as we now require them to keep phones in their lockers? Will we need to carve out lens-free time in our evenings to enjoy old-fashioned, healthy activities such as watching TV or playing video games? “It’s a fool’s errand to imagine every use of AR before we have the hardware in our hands,” writes the developer Adrian Hon, who was called on by Google to write games for their smartglasses a decade ago. “Yet there’s one use of AR glasses that few are talking about but will be world-changing: scraping data from everything we see.” This “worldscraping” would be a big tech dream – and a privacy activist’s nightmare. A pair of smartglasses turns people into walking CCTV cameras, and the data that a canny company could gather from that is mindboggling. Every time someone browsed a supermarket, their smartglasses would be recording real-time pricing data, stock levels and browsing habits; every time they opened up a newspaper, their glasses would know which stories they read, which adverts they looked at and which celebrity beach pictures their gaze lingered on. “We won’t be able to opt out from wearing AR glasses in 2035 any more than we can opt out of owning smartphones today,” Hon writes. “Billions have no choice but to use them for basic tasks like education, banking, communication and accessing government services. In just a few years time, AR glasses do the same, but faster and better.” Apple would argue that, if any company is to control such a powerful technology, it ought to. The company declined to speak on the record for this story, but it has invested time and money in making the case that it can be trusted not to abuse its power. The company points to its comparatively simple business model: make things, and sell them for a lot of money. It isn’t Google or Facebook, trying to monetise personal data, or Amazon, trying to replace the high street – it’s just a company that happens to make a £1,000 phone that it can sell to 150 million people a year. But whether we trust Apple might be beside the point, if we don’t yet know whether we can trust ourselves. It took eight years from the launch of the iPhone for screen time controls to follow. What will human interaction look like eight years after smartglasses become ubiquitous? Our cyborg present sneaked up on us as our phones became glued to our hands. Are we going to sleepwalk into our cyborg future in the same way?",

The messaging app is to begin paying its users for their most viral snaps, as the platform moves to head off a feared exodus to TikTok with a new feed of user-generated content. The new feature, called Spotlight, will be a major change to how Snapchat users find content on the platform – and also represents one of the most serious efforts yet on the part of a social media company to share revenue with all its users, rather than a narrow selection of the most famous creators. “Spotlight will surface the most entertaining snaps from the Snapchat community all in one place, and will become tailored to each Snapchatter over time based on their preferences and favourites,” Snap said in a statement. “As a way to celebrate and reward the creativity of the Snapchat community, Snap will distribute over $1m every day to Snapchatters who create the top Snaps on Spotlight, at least through the end of the year.” The company created the new feature after realising that videos created with the Snapchat camera were regularly going viral on other platforms, such as TikTok and YouTube, because creators had little opportunity to grow their audience on Snapchat itself. For users, the feed will be reminiscent of TikTok’s “For You” page, the crown jewels of the video-sharing app. But behind the scenes, Snap’s philosophy is very different.

          "body": "<p>For the last year, Anna (not her real name) has been working as an Amazon “associate”, in the kind of vast warehouse the company calls a fulfilment centre. For £10.50 an hour, she works four days a week, though, during busy periods, this sometimes goes up to five. Her shift begins at 7.15am and ends at 5.45pm. “When I get home,” she says, “it’s about 6.30. And I just go in, take a shower and go to bed. I’m always exhausted.”</p> <p>Anna is a picker in one of the company’s most technologically advanced workplaces, in the south of England. This means she works in a metal enclosure in front of a screen that flashes up images of the products she has to put in the “totes” destined for the part of the warehouse where customer orders are made ready for posting out. Everything from DVDs to gardening equipment is brought to her by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/nov/25/cobot-machine-coming-job-robots-amazon-ocado\">robot “drives”</a>: squat, droid-like devices that endlessly lift “pods” <strong> – </strong>tall<strong> </strong>fabric towers full of pockets that contain everything from DVDs to toys – and then speed them to the pickers.</p> <p>Everything has to happen quickly. According to the all-important metric by which a picker’s performance is measured, Anna says she has to average 360 items an hour, or around 3,800 a day. This translates as one item every 6.7 seconds.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There were problems with the air-con [in the warehouse]. Maintenance checked the temperature, and it was more than 30C</p> <footer> <cite>Anna</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In March, the Covid-19 lockdown meant that customer orders suddenly rocketed. Anna says that lots of her colleagues started putting in overtime, and new recruits arrived en masse. “They hired a lot of people,” she says. “I thought there should have been fewer people in the warehouse, to have distancing.” Suddenly, there wasn’t enough space in the canteen. “They took out some of the tables because of 2-metre distancing, but it was impossible to find a free table or chair. You had to stand.”</p> <p>Only in April did masks become mandatory. “The first month,” she says, “I was asking for antibacterial gel, for wipes … basic things.” Anna says she still has an issue with how regularly masks can be changed. “You can only get one when you’re starting your shift. That’s a problem. You know the basic blue mask? It should be changed, I don’t know, every few hours. But people have to work with the same one the whole day.”</p> <p>When summer arrived, the warehouse became unbearably hot. “There were problems with the air-con. Maintenance people checked the temperature, and it was more than 30C [85F]. I said: ‘You’re expecting me to do my rate, but in this situation, when we cannot breathe because we have masks on our faces, it’s very hard.’ They fixed it for one or two days, and then it was the same. There was a constant problem with the air-con. For the whole summer.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1990207da83bf56fb847c9c6b6e77da3a5dd5f10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1990207da83bf56fb847c9c6b6e77da3a5dd5f10/0_0_1949_1949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The core of the warehouse is essentially a giant supermarket, where pickers assemble orders in trolleys.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The core of the warehouse is essentially a giant supermarket, where pickers assemble orders in trolleys.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Steven Gregor/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In response to the pandemic, Amazon <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8241103/Amazon-gives-staff-2-hour-pay-rise-customers-shopping.html\">increased workers’ pay</a> by £2 an hour, but this rise was <a href=\"https://leftfootforward.org/2020/06/amazon-warehouse-workers-lose-additional-covid-pay/\">withdrawn in June</a>. Anna says some staff are now employed to monitor distancing in the warehouse, and ensure that nowhere becomes overcrowded. She says there have been unconfirmed rumours of at least one case of the virus<strong> </strong>there. “I think lots of people worry about Covid-19,” she says. “But people are afraid to lose their jobs.”</p> <p>Before the Covid-19 crisis, Amazon was already a vast presence in the economy and its customers’ lives, but now its reach and sheer size is almost beyond comprehension. At the end of July, the company <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/30/amazon-amzn-earnings-q2-2020.html\">announced</a> that it had doubled its quarterly profits to $5.2bn (£3.95bn), compared with $2.6bn at the same point in 2019. Net sales had risen by 40%. “This was another highly unusual quarter, and I couldn’t be more proud of and grateful to our employees around the globe,” said Jeff Bezos, the man who founded Amazon in Seattle, owns 11% of its shares, and recently became the first person whose net worth was <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/26/amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-worth-more-than-200-billion.html\">reckoned to exceed $200</a>bn.</p> <p>A few weeks ago, Amazon <a href=\"https://theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/29/amazon-profits-latest-earnings-report-third-quarter-pandemic\">announced results</a> from the following quarter, and yet another boost to sales and profits. Now Christmas looms, while lockdowns have returned across the world, sending even more customers its way. Every time “nonessential” bricks-and-mortar shops are told to close, you can sense the company once again seizing its chances, and a great social and economic transformation gaining pace. Amazon’s rise highlights big questions about where the world is heading, and what this means for the future of work. As well as making jobs more physically punishing, could Amazon eliminate the need for human labour altogether? And as this 21st-century giant grows, how are people challenging its power, and trying to come up with alternatives?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In Newark, New Jersey, 30-year-old Courtenay Brown works the night shift as a supervisor at a warehouse dedicated to Amazon Fresh, the food delivery service whose popularity has hugely increased since the pandemic began (in the UK, it has long been available in London and the home counties, but there are now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/28/amazon-plans-big-expansion-of-uk-online-grocery-service\">plans to serve cities including Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh</a>).<strong> </strong>Her official shift runs from 6pm to 5.30am, for a rate of $17.30 an hour, and she says she has never worked so hard: “I never used to come in as early, or leave as late. It’s so tiring – thinking about it makes me want to cry.” Most of the orders she oversees go to New York City, and demand is constantly increasing. “Every week, sometimes every day, we’re breaking records,” she says. “Everyone has come to the realisation now that we’ve actually outgrown the warehouse.</p> <p>“We haven’t stopped hiring since the pandemic started,” she tells me. She acknowledges that availability of masks and sanitiser markedly improved after the first couple of months of the pandemic. But, like Anna, she talks about how she feels the rooms used for meals and breaks are inadequate: some workers, she says, have had no option but to spend downtime in their cars.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1fa441e59ae81fd615dc611c7f95fcb299a41f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1fa441e59ae81fd615dc611c7f95fcb299a41f3/0_0_5057_3034/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Courtenay Brown … ‘It’s so tiring – thinking about it makes me want to cry.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Courtenay Brown … ‘It’s so tiring – thinking about it makes me want to cry.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seth Wenig/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The core of her warehouse is essentially a giant supermarket, where pickers assemble orders in trolleys, and the area set aside for refrigerated goods, she says, is “constantly crowded”. Some workers are designated “SD ambassadors”, who are meant to enforce social distancing, but she says that over time they have become a lot less visible. Meanwhile, after an apparent drop in cases of the virus at the warehouse, the numbers seem to be creeping back up: “We’re back at the point where every couple of days now we’re getting text messages about confirmed cases.”</p> <p>Via an emailed set of responses from the company, Amazon insists that since the earliest days of the pandemic it has “prioritised the safety and health of its employees”, and spent “over $800m on safety measures in the first half of the year alone, including personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning, staggered and flexible shifts, revisions at workstations and developing in-house Covid-19 testing capabilities.” In the UK, the company says, “associates” have been provided with 53m masks, 2.6m litres of sanitiser, 66m pairs of gloves and 244m wipes.</p> <p>Workers’ performance “is measured and evaluated over a long period of time as we know that a variety of things could impact the ability to meet expectations in any given day or hour”. The company says it has “invested millions in air-conditioning across our fulfilment network”, and that jobs at Amazon “come with industry-leading pay and competitive benefits” – including, in the UK, “a minimum wage of £9.70 an hour (or £10.80 depending on location), and comprehensive benefits including health insurance from day one and company-funded upskilling opportunities.”</p> <p>A fortnight or so before I began exploring Amazon’s passage into the Covid-19 era, I bowed to the inevitable, went on Amazon, and bought a book about the company, simply titled Amazon, subtitled How the World’s Most Relentless Retailer Will Continue to Revolutionize Commerce, and written by the retail analysts Natalie Berg and Miya Knights.</p> <p>“Amazon sells everything from nappies to treadmills, but it also produces hit television shows and provides cloud computing services to the US government,” Berg and Knights write. “Amazon wants to be a supermarket, a bank, a healthcare provider and, by the time you’re reading this, it will probably be on the cusp of disrupting at least one more industry.”</p> <p>As Berg reminds me over the phone from her home in London, it is hard to keep up with Amazon’s endless innovations and its ever-expanding reach. She says that before the pandemic, she had expected the company’s sheer dominance to sooner or later result in “peak Amazon” and some kind of backlash. But, for now, confinement in our homes and endless hours left empty by the demise of socialising has only increased Amazon’s ubiquity, not least when it comes to things – the Echo unit, Amazon’s entry into TV, and its home-security devices – that push the company way beyond simply selling and delivering stuff.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Do we say: ‘Be nice, Jeff?' Or do we establish a legal framework that makes it impossible to do what they’re doing?</p> <footer> <cite>Tim Bray</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“For the past decade, most retailers were busy investing in catching up online,” she says. “But Amazon was quietly embedding itself in people’s <em>homes</em>. So when Covid hit, they had this unique opportunity to capture these customers.”</p> <p>“You’ll never get a major retailer boasting about opportunity in the middle of a pandemic,” she goes on. “But it’s clear that the timing and very nature of Covid has been fortunate for Amazon. I think they’ll be the only retailer in the UK, possibly the world, to come out stronger on the other side. If there are winners and losers of the pandemic, Amazon is hands-down the winner.”</p> <p>Only <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2016/10/06/technology/amazon-warehouse-robots/index.html\">about a minute of human labour</a> is now reckoned to go into the average Amazon parcel. As a result, as people’s spending moves from physical shops to the internet, the amount of work and person-to-person contact involved in shopping dwindles<strong>. </strong>Amazon recently announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/sep/03/amazon-steps-up-hiring-spree-with-push-for-7000-new-staff-in-uk\">plans to recruit 8,000 more workers</a> in the UK; meanwhile, in the first eight months of 2020, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/sep/09/almost-125000-uk-retail-jobs-lost-so-far-this-year-study-estimates\">125,000 jobs were lost in UK retail</a>. As evidenced by recent announcements about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/nov/04/four-uk-companies-announce-job-losses-totalling-4200\">redundancies at Argos, John Lewis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/06/edinburgh-woollen-mill-ponden-home-collapse-loss-of-860-jobs\">the Edinburgh Woollen Mill chain</a>, the disruption and pain on the high street are only going to continue.</p> <p>Carl Benedikt Frey is an Oxford academic whose book <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/2019/09/04/book-review-the-technology-trap-capital-labour-and-power-in-the-age-of-automation-by-carl-frey/\">The Technology Trap</a> is a superb guide to 21st-century automation and its disruptive effects. His work is smattered with mentions of Amazon: its trials of delivery drones, the Amazon Go stores in which there are no checkouts. He tells me that an overlooked driver of automation is the hardship that the pandemic has let loose and people’s resulting demand for cheaper goods.</p> <p>“We saw something similar during the Great Recession [ie, the aftermath of the 2008 crash], where consumers became cash-strapped and opted for cheaper goods and services, which are usually produced using more automation technology,” he says. “Think about when you go to McDonald’s, which uses more labour-saving technology – touch-screen ordering, and so on – rather than go to a restaurant. If everybody switches, that increases the level of automation in the economy. And what we’re seeing with Amazon now is basically the same, but on a much larger scale. And it’s not just driven by the fact that Amazon is cheaper – there’s also the fact that so many high-street shops have closed down. So Amazon is, for a lot of people, becoming the only option.”</p> <p>Even within Amazon, automation is rapidly reshaping the world of work. In some fulfilment centres, pickers still do things the old-fashioned way, and walk around, taking items from different shelves. At state-of-the-art Amazon warehouses, such as the one in which Anna works, they remain stationary, while robots bring them the goods.</p> <p>Watching them closeup – as I have, at a vast fulfilment centre near Manchester airport – you get the sense that these workers may be mere placeholders for the next generation of robots, and that the fast, monotonous way they work is more about readying tasks for automation than being suited to the skills and needs of human beings. This issue is a lot less abstract than it may sound. Some reports have highlighted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/30/accidents-at-amazon-workers-left-to-suffer-after-warehouse-injuries\">back injuries</a>. A recent article published by the US organisation the Center for Investigative Reporting claimed that an “injury crisis” at Amazon warehouses was especially pronounced at “robotic facilities”.</p> <p>The same piece quoted a US physician who had inspected Amazon workplaces for the US government’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration: “If you’ve got robots that are moving product faster and workers have to then lift or move those products faster, there’ll be increased injuries.” (Amazon says that “we continue to set productivity targets objectively, based on previous performance levels achieved by our workforce”, and that the company supports people “who are not performing to the levels expected with dedicated coaching to help them improve”.)</p> <p>The sense that Amazon’s endgame may be a fully automated workplace is evidenced by the company’s annual competition for the designers of robotic hands. “More dextrous robot-hands and artificial intelligence potentially allows for the automation of order-picking, which is employing a lot of people in warehouses,” says Frey. In a post-pandemic world, such innovations offer another benefit: robots can’t catch Covid-19.</p> <p>If this is the future of employment – and unemployment – it is no surprise that amid the disorientation and fear sown by the pandemic, Amazon’s fulfilment centres have become the focus of rising dissent and protest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"1243f396b914e5f6fa95fdcdc18bc28f503428a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1243f396b914e5f6fa95fdcdc18bc28f503428a5/0_0_4129_2225/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘I don’t think Amazon is uniquely evil or really the problem – I think the whole structure of the economy is the problem.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"539\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I don’t think Amazon is uniquely evil or really the problem – I think the whole structure of the economy is the problem.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Steven Gregor/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Until the end of April 2020, Tim Bray, 65, who now lives in Vancouver, worked for Amazon in a completely different world from that of its packers and pickers: Amazon Web Services (AWS), the hugely successful wing of the company that provides cloud computing not just to the company’s other divisions but to a great many public- and private-sector organisations. (The Guardian uses AWS for many of its cloud-computing operations.) Bray was a company vice-president. These days, he is what the New York Times calls <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/technology/amazon-critic-tim-bray.html\">“Amazon’s highest-profile defector”</a>.</p> <p>As he explains when we speak on Google Meet, Bray is a passionate environmentalist, and in 2019, his was the highest-profile name among more than 8,000 Amazon employees who <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18304800/amazon-employees-open-letter-climate-change-plan\">signed a letter</a> imploring the company to do more to address the climate crisis. When the initiative, under the banner of Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, went public, Bray had “a long talk” with a member of the company’s “S team”, the 26-strong group of executives who sit at the very top of the organisation. “It ended on a certain amount of agree-to-disagree,” he tells me.</p> <p>In September 2019, Amazon launched <a href=\"https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/\">its “Climate Pledge</a>”, promising to become zero-carbon across its operations by 2040, and encouraging other companies to follow suit. “I was really pleased by that,” Bray tells me, though he says he hasn’t noticed much concrete progress on that front. (Amazon counters that it “remains steadfast in our focus on meeting the Climate Pledge”, and has invested in everything from electric cars to renewable projects.)</p> <p>Five months later, with the arrival of the pandemic, some of the people involved in the Climate Justice group started to focus their attention on the issue of safety in fulfilment centres. They circulated a petition calling on the company to expand sick leave and childcare for warehouse staff, and to have a temporary shut down of facilities where workers were confirmed to have the virus so that working environments could be sterilised.</p> <p>Towards the end of March, workers at a warehouse in New York had raised the alarm over a lack of protective equipment, the imposition of overtime, and concern about colleagues falling ill. An employee called Chris Smalls, whose work involved supervising pickers, led a walkout, and was subsequently fired – having, the company said, “received multiple warnings for violating social distancing guidelines”. By this time, safety concerns had been reported in the media, and an online meeting was held at which warehouse workers spoke at length to people from the company’s tech divisions, and heard from the author and activist Naomi Klein.</p> <p>In mid-April, two employees from Amazon’s tech division who had been involved in setting up the meeting were then <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/amazon-fires-staten-island-coronavirus-strike-leader-chris-smalls.html\">dismissed for “repeatedly violating” company rules</a> (the company says that “we support every employee’s right to criticise their employer’s working conditions, but that does not come with blanket immunity against any and all internal policies”). This was the issue that triggered Bray’s resignation, which attracted attention across the world. “A grumpy, old, well-off white guy rage-quit,” he marvels, “and I got thousands and thousands and thousands of responses.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"de62d6e4b26b934d83273bad701dcf82c880444b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de62d6e4b26b934d83273bad701dcf82c880444b/0_1_2800_3498/800.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Bray … accused Amazon of having a ‘vein of toxicity’.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Bray … accused Amazon of having a ‘vein of toxicity’.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alana Peterson/New York Times/Redux/eyevine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He explained his actions in a blog titled <a href=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/04/29/Leaving-Amazon\">Bye, Amazon</a>, which accused the company of having a “vein of toxicity”. On Covid measures in fulfilment centres, Bray credited the company with “putting massive efforts into warehouse safety”, but the big problem, he claimed, was the way Amazon appears to treat its human employees as interchangeable “units of pick-and-pack potential”. As he reiterates in our conversation, he sees the controversies swirling around Amazon as being symptomatic of much deeper issues, which can only be resolved by governments.</p> <p>“I don’t think Amazon is uniquely evil – I think the whole structure of the economy is the problem,” he tells me. But some people, I suggest, would say that risks letting the company off the hook. If it’s even halfway conscious of its corporate reputation, given that the company makes so much money, it could easily afford to behave very differently.</p> <p>“Well, there are two issues there,” he says. “You raised the issue of reputation. And, I think we can all agree that Amazon has apparently very little concern for that. One of Amazon’s leadership principles is ‘accept being misunderstood’ [actually “we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time”], which I always thought was an impossibly arrogant thing to say – because it looks like, ‘Well, we’re just smarter than everybody else. And we know what’s right. And others haven’t caught up yet.’ Maybe when you’re a scrappy startup in Seattle, being misunderstood is OK, but when you’re the world’s largest and most powerful company, it’s a problem.</p> <p>“So, yeah, there is an ethical issue in there. Absolutely. So do we lecture Jeff Bezos and say: ‘Be nice, Jeff, play nice, be a better person’? Or do we establish a legal and regulatory framework that simply makes it impossible to do what they’re doing?”</p> <p>Bray is one of the increasing number of voices who think that Amazon should be broken up. He says a lot hangs on the immediate political future of the US, and what happens to the balance of power in the Senate (though Europe is relevant, too: witness the EU’s recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/10/amazon-charged-with-abusing-eu-competition-rules\">charges against the company</a>, relating to its alleged treatment of the independent sellers who use its platforms). He also thinks that Amazon workers should be allowed to be collectively represented by trade unions – the demand of a growing network of employees and activists across Europe and the US whose attentions are relentlessly focused on how the company treats its huge army of workers.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Amazon UK tells me that “we respect our employees’ right to join, form or not to join a labour union or other lawful organisation of their own selection, without fear of retaliation, intimidation or harassment”. The company also insists that “we already have works councils and employee bodies at Amazon”. There is also mention of “the ability to communicate directly with the leadership of the company”.</p> <p>Back in April, the French Sud Commerce trade union <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/amazon-sales-non-essentials-french-court-ruling-union\">took Amazon to court</a>, declaring the company’s workplaces to be unsafe after the virus flared up at some of them. The result was an order to stop selling anything other than “essential” items, which led to the temporary closure of Amazon’s six fulfilment centres in France. They began to reopen in May, but activists concerned about safety see this as proof that even a giant as big as this can sometimes be brought to heel.</p> <p>In the UK, the key trade union focusing on Amazon workers is the 600,000-member GMB. Amazon does not formally recognise the union as a body to be negotiated with, but GMB officials can still accompany workers to internal disciplinary meetings, and do their best to follow what goes on in fulfilment centres. Before the pandemic, the GMB was regularly raising questions about workers’ safety; of late, it has made a lot of noise about the fulfilment centre in Coventry, where there have been at least 30 cases so far in a Covid-19 outbreak that began in October.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/amazon-workers-of-the-world-unite-jeff-bezos-protest/\">Amazon Workers International</a> is a new umbrella group that brings together workers from countries including Germany, Poland, Spain, France, Slovakia and the US, many of whom have been at the centre of warehouse stoppages and protests. In the US, a lot of heat is generated by United 4 Respect, an advocacy group focused on improving the lives of retail workers. There is also a new coalition of organisations called Athena, which wants to “stop Amazon’s growing, powerful grip over our society and economy”. All these things blur into informal networks of people using social media to share experiences of working for Amazon, and highlight issues arising from its dominance.</p> <p>Jana Jumpp lives in Louisville, Kentucky. Until earlier this year, she worked in a huge fulfilment centre across the state line in Jeffersonville, Indiana, in the dock where trucks collect and drop off goods. After the usual Christmas peak, she took six weeks of unpaid leave to focus on training as a massage therapist, before briefly returning to work just as the pandemic began to spread across the US.</p> <p>“I went back for a weekend, and I was like, ‘I don’t really feel comfortable with this whole thing,’” she tells me. “It was really starting to spread, and they didn’t have any masks, they didn’t talk about taking [workers’] temperatures, they didn’t talk about <em>anything</em>. They didn’t seem to have any kind of protocol, you know?”</p> <p>At that point, Amazon had responded to the pandemic by offering workers unlimited unpaid time off. Jumpp quietly left her job behind, and now earns a living as a domestic cleaner. But since her exit, she has spent long hours trying to trace Covid-19 outbreaks at Amazon warehouses, building a network of people who she says forward her the texts and voicemail messages the company sends employees when there are cases of the virus in their workplaces. These do not tend to mention specific numbers: the most people usually know is whether there is a single case – or, if messages mention “cases”, more than one. As a result, the figures Jumpp has compiled have inevitably underestimated the real numbers, but she thinks her work has helped in forcing Amazon to announce that <a href=\"https://www.citynews1130.com/2020/07/19/workers-turn-into-amateur-sleuths-to-track-virus-cases/\"> more than 19,000 of its workers in the US had contracted Covid-19</a> since the pandemic began (42% less than the “general population rate”, according to the company).</p> <p>Looking ahead to Christmas, Jumpp says she fears the worst. “On 2 and 3 July, they had mandatory overtime, and they were cramming everybody in there, and then two weeks later I had a big spike in cases. So I think the big concern is peak season. Peak season is crazy; tons of people in there. And I’m expecting a lot of cases.” In answer to this point, the company says that “without a specific site, this is hard to substantiate”, but tells me that “we are anything but complacent and continue to innovate, learn, and improve the measures we have in place to protect our teams”.</p> <p>Amazon’s growth continues. The actor and model Cara Delevingne is now the public face of a newly launched arm called <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/amazon-launches-luxury-stores\">Luxury Stores</a>, which is available in the US on an “invite-only” basis, and sells goods made by brands such as Oscar de la Renta and La Perla. In September, Amazon announced the launch of the Ring Always Home Cam, a drone-like security device that can fly around people’s homes in response to security alerts, and stream them footage of any potential disturbance. The same month saw the arrival of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/amazon-launches-a-virtual-tours-and-experience-platform-amazon-explore/\">Amazon Explore</a> – a Zoom-like service that offers such experiences as “a virtual tour of Mexico City’s urban art scene” ($47 for 50 minutes) and “personal styling and shopping experience” led by a Mississippi-based women’s boutique called Libby Story, a comparative snip at $20 for an hour.</p> <p>As ever, it all evokes the boundless world of plenty and convenience that millions of us find irresistible, whatever the controversies that swirl around the company. “I don’t shop on Amazon any more, only because I know what’s going on there,” says Jumpp. “But a lot of people don’t care. Especially when the pandemic first started, when I spoke to people I know, I was like: ‘Can you just order what you need and not what you want?’ And it’s like: ‘Whatever, it’s not my problem.’ You know what I mean?”</p>",

          "bodyText": "For the last year, Anna (not her real name) has been working as an Amazon “associate”, in the kind of vast warehouse the company calls a fulfilment centre. For £10.50 an hour, she works four days a week, though, during busy periods, this sometimes goes up to five. Her shift begins at 7.15am and ends at 5.45pm. “When I get home,” she says, “it’s about 6.30. And I just go in, take a shower and go to bed. I’m always exhausted.” Anna is a picker in one of the company’s most technologically advanced workplaces, in the south of England. This means she works in a metal enclosure in front of a screen that flashes up images of the products she has to put in the “totes” destined for the part of the warehouse where customer orders are made ready for posting out. Everything from DVDs to gardening equipment is brought to her by robot “drives”: squat, droid-like devices that endlessly lift “pods” – tall fabric towers full of pockets that contain everything from DVDs to toys – and then speed them to the pickers. Everything has to happen quickly. According to the all-important metric by which a picker’s performance is measured, Anna says she has to average 360 items an hour, or around 3,800 a day. This translates as one item every 6.7 seconds. In March, the Covid-19 lockdown meant that customer orders suddenly rocketed. Anna says that lots of her colleagues started putting in overtime, and new recruits arrived en masse. “They hired a lot of people,” she says. “I thought there should have been fewer people in the warehouse, to have distancing.” Suddenly, there wasn’t enough space in the canteen. “They took out some of the tables because of 2-metre distancing, but it was impossible to find a free table or chair. You had to stand.” Only in April did masks become mandatory. “The first month,” she says, “I was asking for antibacterial gel, for wipes … basic things.” Anna says she still has an issue with how regularly masks can be changed. “You can only get one when you’re starting your shift. That’s a problem. You know the basic blue mask? It should be changed, I don’t know, every few hours. But people have to work with the same one the whole day.” When summer arrived, the warehouse became unbearably hot. “There were problems with the air-con. Maintenance people checked the temperature, and it was more than 30C [85F]. I said: ‘You’re expecting me to do my rate, but in this situation, when we cannot breathe because we have masks on our faces, it’s very hard.’ They fixed it for one or two days, and then it was the same. There was a constant problem with the air-con. For the whole summer.” In response to the pandemic, Amazon increased workers’ pay by £2 an hour, but this rise was withdrawn in June. Anna says some staff are now employed to monitor distancing in the warehouse, and ensure that nowhere becomes overcrowded. She says there have been unconfirmed rumours of at least one case of the virus there. “I think lots of people worry about Covid-19,” she says. “But people are afraid to lose their jobs.” Before the Covid-19 crisis, Amazon was already a vast presence in the economy and its customers’ lives, but now its reach and sheer size is almost beyond comprehension. At the end of July, the company announced that it had doubled its quarterly profits to $5.2bn (£3.95bn), compared with $2.6bn at the same point in 2019. Net sales had risen by 40%. “This was another highly unusual quarter, and I couldn’t be more proud of and grateful to our employees around the globe,” said Jeff Bezos, the man who founded Amazon in Seattle, owns 11% of its shares, and recently became the first person whose net worth was reckoned to exceed $200bn. A few weeks ago, Amazon announced results from the following quarter, and yet another boost to sales and profits. Now Christmas looms, while lockdowns have returned across the world, sending even more customers its way. Every time “nonessential” bricks-and-mortar shops are told to close, you can sense the company once again seizing its chances, and a great social and economic transformation gaining pace. Amazon’s rise highlights big questions about where the world is heading, and what this means for the future of work. As well as making jobs more physically punishing, could Amazon eliminate the need for human labour altogether? And as this 21st-century giant grows, how are people challenging its power, and trying to come up with alternatives? * * * In Newark, New Jersey, 30-year-old Courtenay Brown works the night shift as a supervisor at a warehouse dedicated to Amazon Fresh, the food delivery service whose popularity has hugely increased since the pandemic began (in the UK, it has long been available in London and the home counties, but there are now plans to serve cities including Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh). Her official shift runs from 6pm to 5.30am, for a rate of $17.30 an hour, and she says she has never worked so hard: “I never used to come in as early, or leave as late. It’s so tiring – thinking about it makes me want to cry.” Most of the orders she oversees go to New York City, and demand is constantly increasing. “Every week, sometimes every day, we’re breaking records,” she says. “Everyone has come to the realisation now that we’ve actually outgrown the warehouse. “We haven’t stopped hiring since the pandemic started,” she tells me. She acknowledges that availability of masks and sanitiser markedly improved after the first couple of months of the pandemic. But, like Anna, she talks about how she feels the rooms used for meals and breaks are inadequate: some workers, she says, have had no option but to spend downtime in their cars. The core of her warehouse is essentially a giant supermarket, where pickers assemble orders in trolleys, and the area set aside for refrigerated goods, she says, is “constantly crowded”. Some workers are designated “SD ambassadors”, who are meant to enforce social distancing, but she says that over time they have become a lot less visible. Meanwhile, after an apparent drop in cases of the virus at the warehouse, the numbers seem to be creeping back up: “We’re back at the point where every couple of days now we’re getting text messages about confirmed cases.” Via an emailed set of responses from the company, Amazon insists that since the earliest days of the pandemic it has “prioritised the safety and health of its employees”, and spent “over $800m on safety measures in the first half of the year alone, including personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning, staggered and flexible shifts, revisions at workstations and developing in-house Covid-19 testing capabilities.” In the UK, the company says, “associates” have been provided with 53m masks, 2.6m litres of sanitiser, 66m pairs of gloves and 244m wipes. Workers’ performance “is measured and evaluated over a long period of time as we know that a variety of things could impact the ability to meet expectations in any given day or hour”. The company says it has “invested millions in air-conditioning across our fulfilment network”, and that jobs at Amazon “come with industry-leading pay and competitive benefits” – including, in the UK, “a minimum wage of £9.70 an hour (or £10.80 depending on location), and comprehensive benefits including health insurance from day one and company-funded upskilling opportunities.” A fortnight or so before I began exploring Amazon’s passage into the Covid-19 era, I bowed to the inevitable, went on Amazon, and bought a book about the company, simply titled Amazon, subtitled How the World’s Most Relentless Retailer Will Continue to Revolutionize Commerce, and written by the retail analysts Natalie Berg and Miya Knights. “Amazon sells everything from nappies to treadmills, but it also produces hit television shows and provides cloud computing services to the US government,” Berg and Knights write. “Amazon wants to be a supermarket, a bank, a healthcare provider and, by the time you’re reading this, it will probably be on the cusp of disrupting at least one more industry.” As Berg reminds me over the phone from her home in London, it is hard to keep up with Amazon’s endless innovations and its ever-expanding reach. She says that before the pandemic, she had expected the company’s sheer dominance to sooner or later result in “peak Amazon” and some kind of backlash. But, for now, confinement in our homes and endless hours left empty by the demise of socialising has only increased Amazon’s ubiquity, not least when it comes to things – the Echo unit, Amazon’s entry into TV, and its home-security devices – that push the company way beyond simply selling and delivering stuff. “For the past decade, most retailers were busy investing in catching up online,” she says. “But Amazon was quietly embedding itself in people’s homes. So when Covid hit, they had this unique opportunity to capture these customers.” “You’ll never get a major retailer boasting about opportunity in the middle of a pandemic,” she goes on. “But it’s clear that the timing and very nature of Covid has been fortunate for Amazon. I think they’ll be the only retailer in the UK, possibly the world, to come out stronger on the other side. If there are winners and losers of the pandemic, Amazon is hands-down the winner.” Only about a minute of human labour is now reckoned to go into the average Amazon parcel. As a result, as people’s spending moves from physical shops to the internet, the amount of work and person-to-person contact involved in shopping dwindles. Amazon recently announced plans to recruit 8,000 more workers in the UK; meanwhile, in the first eight months of 2020, 125,000 jobs were lost in UK retail. As evidenced by recent announcements about redundancies at Argos, John Lewis and the Edinburgh Woollen Mill chain, the disruption and pain on the high street are only going to continue. Carl Benedikt Frey is an Oxford academic whose book The Technology Trap is a superb guide to 21st-century automation and its disruptive effects. His work is smattered with mentions of Amazon: its trials of delivery drones, the Amazon Go stores in which there are no checkouts. He tells me that an overlooked driver of automation is the hardship that the pandemic has let loose and people’s resulting demand for cheaper goods. “We saw something similar during the Great Recession [ie, the aftermath of the 2008 crash], where consumers became cash-strapped and opted for cheaper goods and services, which are usually produced using more automation technology,” he says. “Think about when you go to McDonald’s, which uses more labour-saving technology – touch-screen ordering, and so on – rather than go to a restaurant. If everybody switches, that increases the level of automation in the economy. And what we’re seeing with Amazon now is basically the same, but on a much larger scale. And it’s not just driven by the fact that Amazon is cheaper – there’s also the fact that so many high-street shops have closed down. So Amazon is, for a lot of people, becoming the only option.” Even within Amazon, automation is rapidly reshaping the world of work. In some fulfilment centres, pickers still do things the old-fashioned way, and walk around, taking items from different shelves. At state-of-the-art Amazon warehouses, such as the one in which Anna works, they remain stationary, while robots bring them the goods. Watching them closeup – as I have, at a vast fulfilment centre near Manchester airport – you get the sense that these workers may be mere placeholders for the next generation of robots, and that the fast, monotonous way they work is more about readying tasks for automation than being suited to the skills and needs of human beings. This issue is a lot less abstract than it may sound. Some reports have highlighted back injuries. A recent article published by the US organisation the Center for Investigative Reporting claimed that an “injury crisis” at Amazon warehouses was especially pronounced at “robotic facilities”. The same piece quoted a US physician who had inspected Amazon workplaces for the US government’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration: “If you’ve got robots that are moving product faster and workers have to then lift or move those products faster, there’ll be increased injuries.” (Amazon says that “we continue to set productivity targets objectively, based on previous performance levels achieved by our workforce”, and that the company supports people “who are not performing to the levels expected with dedicated coaching to help them improve”.) The sense that Amazon’s endgame may be a fully automated workplace is evidenced by the company’s annual competition for the designers of robotic hands. “More dextrous robot-hands and artificial intelligence potentially allows for the automation of order-picking, which is employing a lot of people in warehouses,” says Frey. In a post-pandemic world, such innovations offer another benefit: robots can’t catch Covid-19. If this is the future of employment – and unemployment – it is no surprise that amid the disorientation and fear sown by the pandemic, Amazon’s fulfilment centres have become the focus of rising dissent and protest. * * * Until the end of April 2020, Tim Bray, 65, who now lives in Vancouver, worked for Amazon in a completely different world from that of its packers and pickers: Amazon Web Services (AWS), the hugely successful wing of the company that provides cloud computing not just to the company’s other divisions but to a great many public- and private-sector organisations. (The Guardian uses AWS for many of its cloud-computing operations.) Bray was a company vice-president. These days, he is what the New York Times calls “Amazon’s highest-profile defector”. As he explains when we speak on Google Meet, Bray is a passionate environmentalist, and in 2019, his was the highest-profile name among more than 8,000 Amazon employees who signed a letter imploring the company to do more to address the climate crisis. When the initiative, under the banner of Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, went public, Bray had “a long talk” with a member of the company’s “S team”, the 26-strong group of executives who sit at the very top of the organisation. “It ended on a certain amount of agree-to-disagree,” he tells me. In September 2019, Amazon launched its “Climate Pledge”, promising to become zero-carbon across its operations by 2040, and encouraging other companies to follow suit. “I was really pleased by that,” Bray tells me, though he says he hasn’t noticed much concrete progress on that front. (Amazon counters that it “remains steadfast in our focus on meeting the Climate Pledge”, and has invested in everything from electric cars to renewable projects.) Five months later, with the arrival of the pandemic, some of the people involved in the Climate Justice group started to focus their attention on the issue of safety in fulfilment centres. They circulated a petition calling on the company to expand sick leave and childcare for warehouse staff, and to have a temporary shut down of facilities where workers were confirmed to have the virus so that working environments could be sterilised. Towards the end of March, workers at a warehouse in New York had raised the alarm over a lack of protective equipment, the imposition of overtime, and concern about colleagues falling ill. An employee called Chris Smalls, whose work involved supervising pickers, led a walkout, and was subsequently fired – having, the company said, “received multiple warnings for violating social distancing guidelines”. By this time, safety concerns had been reported in the media, and an online meeting was held at which warehouse workers spoke at length to people from the company’s tech divisions, and heard from the author and activist Naomi Klein. In mid-April, two employees from Amazon’s tech division who had been involved in setting up the meeting were then dismissed for “repeatedly violating” company rules (the company says that “we support every employee’s right to criticise their employer’s working conditions, but that does not come with blanket immunity against any and all internal policies”). This was the issue that triggered Bray’s resignation, which attracted attention across the world. “A grumpy, old, well-off white guy rage-quit,” he marvels, “and I got thousands and thousands and thousands of responses.” He explained his actions in a blog titled Bye, Amazon, which accused the company of having a “vein of toxicity”. On Covid measures in fulfilment centres, Bray credited the company with “putting massive efforts into warehouse safety”, but the big problem, he claimed, was the way Amazon appears to treat its human employees as interchangeable “units of pick-and-pack potential”. As he reiterates in our conversation, he sees the controversies swirling around Amazon as being symptomatic of much deeper issues, which can only be resolved by governments. “I don’t think Amazon is uniquely evil – I think the whole structure of the economy is the problem,” he tells me. But some people, I suggest, would say that risks letting the company off the hook. If it’s even halfway conscious of its corporate reputation, given that the company makes so much money, it could easily afford to behave very differently. “Well, there are two issues there,” he says. “You raised the issue of reputation. And, I think we can all agree that Amazon has apparently very little concern for that. One of Amazon’s leadership principles is ‘accept being misunderstood’ [actually “we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time”], which I always thought was an impossibly arrogant thing to say – because it looks like, ‘Well, we’re just smarter than everybody else. And we know what’s right. And others haven’t caught up yet.’ Maybe when you’re a scrappy startup in Seattle, being misunderstood is OK, but when you’re the world’s largest and most powerful company, it’s a problem. “So, yeah, there is an ethical issue in there. Absolutely. So do we lecture Jeff Bezos and say: ‘Be nice, Jeff, play nice, be a better person’? Or do we establish a legal and regulatory framework that simply makes it impossible to do what they’re doing?” Bray is one of the increasing number of voices who think that Amazon should be broken up. He says a lot hangs on the immediate political future of the US, and what happens to the balance of power in the Senate (though Europe is relevant, too: witness the EU’s recent charges against the company, relating to its alleged treatment of the independent sellers who use its platforms). He also thinks that Amazon workers should be allowed to be collectively represented by trade unions – the demand of a growing network of employees and activists across Europe and the US whose attentions are relentlessly focused on how the company treats its huge army of workers. * * * Amazon UK tells me that “we respect our employees’ right to join, form or not to join a labour union or other lawful organisation of their own selection, without fear of retaliation, intimidation or harassment”. The company also insists that “we already have works councils and employee bodies at Amazon”. There is also mention of “the ability to communicate directly with the leadership of the company”. Back in April, the French Sud Commerce trade union took Amazon to court, declaring the company’s workplaces to be unsafe after the virus flared up at some of them. The result was an order to stop selling anything other than “essential” items, which led to the temporary closure of Amazon’s six fulfilment centres in France. They began to reopen in May, but activists concerned about safety see this as proof that even a giant as big as this can sometimes be brought to heel. In the UK, the key trade union focusing on Amazon workers is the 600,000-member GMB. Amazon does not formally recognise the union as a body to be negotiated with, but GMB officials can still accompany workers to internal disciplinary meetings, and do their best to follow what goes on in fulfilment centres. Before the pandemic, the GMB was regularly raising questions about workers’ safety; of late, it has made a lot of noise about the fulfilment centre in Coventry, where there have been at least 30 cases so far in a Covid-19 outbreak that began in October. Amazon Workers International is a new umbrella group that brings together workers from countries including Germany, Poland, Spain, France, Slovakia and the US, many of whom have been at the centre of warehouse stoppages and protests. In the US, a lot of heat is generated by United 4 Respect, an advocacy group focused on improving the lives of retail workers. There is also a new coalition of organisations called Athena, which wants to “stop Amazon’s growing, powerful grip over our society and economy”. All these things blur into informal networks of people using social media to share experiences of working for Amazon, and highlight issues arising from its dominance. Jana Jumpp lives in Louisville, Kentucky. Until earlier this year, she worked in a huge fulfilment centre across the state line in Jeffersonville, Indiana, in the dock where trucks collect and drop off goods. After the usual Christmas peak, she took six weeks of unpaid leave to focus on training as a massage therapist, before briefly returning to work just as the pandemic began to spread across the US. “I went back for a weekend, and I was like, ‘I don’t really feel comfortable with this whole thing,’” she tells me. “It was really starting to spread, and they didn’t have any masks, they didn’t talk about taking [workers’] temperatures, they didn’t talk about anything. They didn’t seem to have any kind of protocol, you know?” At that point, Amazon had responded to the pandemic by offering workers unlimited unpaid time off. Jumpp quietly left her job behind, and now earns a living as a domestic cleaner. But since her exit, she has spent long hours trying to trace Covid-19 outbreaks at Amazon warehouses, building a network of people who she says forward her the texts and voicemail messages the company sends employees when there are cases of the virus in their workplaces. These do not tend to mention specific numbers: the most people usually know is whether there is a single case – or, if messages mention “cases”, more than one. As a result, the figures Jumpp has compiled have inevitably underestimated the real numbers, but she thinks her work has helped in forcing Amazon to announce that more than 19,000 of its workers in the US had contracted Covid-19 since the pandemic began (42% less than the “general population rate”, according to the company). Looking ahead to Christmas, Jumpp says she fears the worst. “On 2 and 3 July, they had mandatory overtime, and they were cramming everybody in there, and then two weeks later I had a big spike in cases. So I think the big concern is peak season. Peak season is crazy; tons of people in there. And I’m expecting a lot of cases.” In answer to this point, the company says that “without a specific site, this is hard to substantiate”, but tells me that “we are anything but complacent and continue to innovate, learn, and improve the measures we have in place to protect our teams”. Amazon’s growth continues. The actor and model Cara Delevingne is now the public face of a newly launched arm called Luxury Stores, which is available in the US on an “invite-only” basis, and sells goods made by brands such as Oscar de la Renta and La Perla. In September, Amazon announced the launch of the Ring Always Home Cam, a drone-like security device that can fly around people’s homes in response to security alerts, and stream them footage of any potential disturbance. The same month saw the arrival of Amazon Explore – a Zoom-like service that offers such experiences as “a virtual tour of Mexico City’s urban art scene” ($47 for 50 minutes) and “personal styling and shopping experience” led by a Mississippi-based women’s boutique called Libby Story, a comparative snip at $20 for an hour. As ever, it all evokes the boundless world of plenty and convenience that millions of us find irresistible, whatever the controversies that swirl around the company. “I don’t shop on Amazon any more, only because I know what’s going on there,” says Jumpp. “But a lot of people don’t care. Especially when the pandemic first started, when I spoke to people I know, I was like: ‘Can you just order what you need and not what you want?’ And it’s like: ‘Whatever, it’s not my problem.’ You know what I mean?”",

          "bodyText": "The UK should revisit its decision to ban the Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei from its 5G network in the post-Trump era and recognise that it will worsen England’s north-south divide, the vice-president of Huawei has told the Guardian.

Dyson, which is owned by Britain’s richest person, Sir James Dyson, last week told all research and development staff that they must return to its two Wiltshire sites, at Malmesbury and Hullavington, with employees only allowed to work from home in “exceptional cases”. The company in May told employees to return to the office, only to cancel its plan after employees objected. But staff told the Guardian they were concerned by the content of emails from senior managers telling them they should come to the office. England began a second lockdown last week, with the country urged to work from home where possible. However, the stay-at-home order does not apply for work activities where “it is not reasonably possible” to do from home. Dyson, which makes electrical products such as bagless vacuum cleaners and fans, is understood to believe it is on firm ground with its decision to ask workers to return to the office after the business secretary, Alok Sharma, told employers at the annual conference of the Confederation of British Industries that research and development activities should continue. Three staff, who asked to remain anonymous, said that the decision, communicated in an email by the chief executive, Roland Krueger, had made many workers upset and angry. One person said that staff had been threatened with disciplinary action if they did not comply. It is understood that about a third of Dyson’s 4,000 UK staff will be covered by the order. While some R&amp;D jobs require labs for testing, some workers in software-focused roles feel they could continue to work from home, as they have done throughout England’s lockdowns. Krueger’s email, seen by the Guardian, said: “I cannot hide that the impact of a lockdown is significant and that it will be damaging to Dyson.

He is worth £16.2bn, according to the Sunday Times, although his company has struggled like many others during the pandemic, and it revealed 900 job cuts in July as it sought to cut costs. A Dyson spokesman said: “The government has stated clearly that people who cannot work from home effectively should go to work and that ‘it is vital’ for manufacturing and R&amp;D organisations to remain open. “Three-quarters of Dyson people, who normally work from our campus, are currently working from home.

          "body": "<p>As with many others in Britain, lockdown hit Rachel and her husband, Philip, hard. Almost overnight, the couple, both in their early 50s, found themselves cut off from friends, family and colleagues. Before the Covid-19 outbreak, they had both been working every day; now Philip found himself furloughed, while Rachel was put on rotation with other essential staff, working fewer shifts at odd hours. They were unable to meet up with their four adult sons and daughters. They had to attend a family funeral while remaining socially distanced.</p> \n<p>Initially, Rachel coped in the way many others did. She played more video games than normal, and felt stressed at work, but as far as possible she managed. Her husband didn’t. For him, it seemed there must be more to it than the authorities struggling to cope with a novel virus and evolving expert advice. “The regularly changing and conflicting information that was coming from the government added to the feeling in him that they were making things up or covering something up,” Rachel says now.</p> \n<p>Initially, Philip and Rachel (their names have been changed for this article) discussed his fears, but as lockdown went on, their conversations stopped. Philip was frustrated that Rachel wasn’t taking his concerns seriously: someone had to be benefiting from the situation, he insisted, and events such as Dominic Cummings’ Barnard Castle “eye test” only increased his belief that “they” knew the pandemic was fake, and the nation was being kept indoors for a more sinister purpose. Philip began to research what this sinister purpose might be. That, Rachel says, is what led him to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/qanon\">QAnon</a>.</p> \n<p>It’s hard to describe the movement that Philip fell into. QAnon has its roots in the “pizzagate” conspiracy, which emerged four years ago after users poring over hacked Democratic party emails on the message board 4chan said that, if you replaced the word “pizza” with “little girl”, it looked as if they were discussing eating children. That claim – whether it was made in jest or sincerity is impossible to tell – spiralled into allegations of a vast paedophilic conspiracy centred on Comet Pizza, a restaurant in Washington DC.</p> \n<p>A year later, a 4chan user with the handle “Q Clearance Patriot” appeared, claiming to be a government insider tasked with sharing “crumbs” of intel about Donald Trump’s planned counter-coup against the deep state forces frustrating his presidency. As Q’s following grew, the movement became known as the Storm – as in, “the calm before …” – and then QAnon, after its founder and prophet.<strong> </strong>At that point, QAnon was a relatively understandable conspiracy theory: it had a clear set of beliefs rooted in support for Trump and in the increasingly cryptic posts attributed to Q (by then widely believed to be a group of people posting under one name).</p> \n<p>Now, though, it’s less clearcut. There’s no one set of beliefs that define a QAnon adherent. Most will claim some form of mass paedophilic conspiracy; some, particularly in the US, continue to focus on Trump’s supposed fightback. But the web of beliefs has become all-encompassing. One fan-produced map of all the “revelations” linked to the group includes references to Julius Caesar, Atlantis and the pharaohs of Egypt in one corner, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and 5G in another, the knights of Malta in a third, and the Fukushima meltdown in a fourth – all tied together with a generous helping of antisemitism, from the Protocols of the Elders of Zion to hatred of George Soros. QAnon isn’t one conspiracy theory any more: it’s all of them at once.</p> \n<p>In September, BuzzFeed News made the stylistic decision to refer to the movement as a “collective delusion”. “There’s more to the convoluted entity than the average reader might realise,” wrote BuzzFeed’s Drusilla Moorhouse and Emerson Malone. “But delusion does illustrate the reality better than conspiracy theory does. We are discussing a mass of people who subscribe to a shared set of values and debunked ideas, which inform their beliefs and actions.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42cb93c070375ede26e1e0d20a5e3c9fd8a9b44b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42cb93c070375ede26e1e0d20a5e3c9fd8a9b44b/0_144_3200_1919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A QAnon sweatshirt at a Trump rally in October.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A QAnon sweatshirt at a Trump rally in October.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephanie Keith/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>At first, QAnon was a largely US phenomenon, with limited penetration in the UK. The pandemic, however, has changed that. According to recent polling by Hope Not Hate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/22/one-in-four-britons-believe-in-qanon-linked-theories-survey\">one in four people in Britain</a> now agree with some of the basic conspiracies it has promulgated: that “secret satanic cults exist and include influential elites”, and that “elites in Hollywood, politics, the media” are secretly engaging in large-scale child trafficking and abuse. Nearly a third believe there is “a single group of people who secretly control events and rule the world together”, and almost a fifth say that Covid-19 was intentionally released as part of a “depopulation plan”.</p> \n<p>For Philip, trapped at home and searching for an explanation for a global pandemic, when all he could find was a void of information, QAnon was fertile territory. He already spent most of his time while furloughed on his phone looking for answers. What was the real reason for everyone being forced inside? How did the virus start? Who started it?</p> \n<p>“In his mind, there had to be a reason for it,” Rachel says. Inevitably, his search took in Facebook, where the site’s recommendation algorithms were quick to connect him to individuals on similar quests.<strong> </strong>“Ultimately, it led to him becoming brainwashed,” she says.</p> \n<p>For many, the existence of Facebook – and its sister products, including WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger – has been a lifeline in this period. The social network has always prided itself on connecting people, and when the ability to socialise in person, or even leave the house, was curtailed, Facebook was there to pick up the slack.</p> \n<p>But those same services have also enabled the creation of what one professional factchecker calls a “perfect storm for misinformation”. And with real-life interaction suppressed to counter the spread of the virus, it’s easier than ever for people to fall deep down a rabbit hole of deception, where the endpoint may not simply be a decline in vaccination rates or the election of an unpleasant president, but the end of consensus reality as we know it. What happens when your basic understanding of the world is no longer the same as your neighbour’s? And can Facebook stop that fate coming to us all?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9f951d88-d641-4390-9ead-32b0377fe6b5\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PYZBxH4I_GA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>Since its foundation, in Mark Zuckerberg’s Harvard dorm room, Facebook has tackled its share of challenges. Some have stayed fairly constant: no social network gets many users without needing to tackle spam, for instance, though the Facebook of 2004 would struggle to remove the 3.3bn junk posts that the company took down in the first half of this year.</p> \n<p>Others are unique to a company with 2.7 billion users that operates in almost every country in the world. Facebook has become a centre point of civil society. It’s more than just a place to share photos and plan parties: it’s where people read news, arrange protests, engage in debate, play games and watch bands. And that means that all the problems of civil society are now problems for Facebook: bullying, sexual abuse, political polarisation and conspiracy theorists all existed before the social network, but all took on new contours as they moved online.</p> \n<p>And this year they <em>really</em> moved online. As the initial lockdown was imposed across much of the world, people’s relationship to the internet, and to Facebook in particular, evolved rapidly. Stuck socially distancing, people turned to social networking to fill an emotional void.</p> \n<p>Suddenly, the company found itself staring at unprecedented demands. “Our busiest time of the year is New Year’s Eve,” says Nicola Mendelsohn, Facebook’s vice-president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, over a Zoom call from her London home. “And we were seeing the equivalent of New Year’s Eve every single day.” It was, she says, the inevitable result of having “almost the entire planet at home at the same time”.</p> \n<p>Rachel agrees. “I believe the lockdown played a huge part in altering people’s perception of reality,” she says. When Covid restrictions came in, the rules of social interaction were rewritten. We suddenly stopped meeting friends in pubs, at the coffee point or by the school gates, and our lives moved online. And for many of us, “online” meant “on Facebook”.</p> \n<p>I first heard Rachel’s story from QAnonCasualties, a forum on the social news site Reddit where she, and thousands like her, have congregated to seek advice and support after their loved ones fell into the cult. Her first post, in July this year, was titled: “I’ve finally reached the end of my tether.” She described a marriage of 25 years, and a family with four grownup children, being shattered by a husband who had sunk “further and further into this conspiracy”.</p> \n<p>“It’s got the stage where I no longer understand him or even recognise him,” she wrote. Others echoed her story. Posts with titles such as “Grieving my dad while he’s still alive” and “Today I filed for divorce from my QAnon-obsessed husband” rub shoulders with pleas for help from those who still hope they can win loved ones back.</p> \n<p>Beyond the heartbreak and anguish on QAnonCasualties, there is a common thread: a feeling that their friends and relatives are inhabiting a different reality. “On all levels, from the old-school conspiracist who just wants to uncover corruption to the alien interdimensional vampire demon QAnon believer, they ignore reality and latch on to narratives that support their version of reality,” says Robert Johnson, one of the moderators of the board, adding that most of the recent posts are from people radicalised in lockdown. </p> \n<p>Early on in the pandemic, Facebook moved to make the most of the situation. As almost all of its 50,000 or so employees, as well as its army of contractors,<strong> </strong>were sent home, and Zuckerberg talked up the benefits of remote working, the company handed out grants to small businesses to help them switch to digital operation – $100m (£79m) globally, and another $100m in the US – and retooled its product offerings to take advantage of the new normal. But for all the work it put into smoothing the transition to lockdown life, Facebook also knew it had a problem brewing. The company’s never-ending battle with misinformation on its platforms was about to step into overdrive.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"539517e04e5236211d9d6915130f3022bfbf907c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/539517e04e5236211d9d6915130f3022bfbf907c/0_234_4873_2925/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘It became clear, very quickly, that there would be different approaches to how people would talk about, debate and discuss the virus …’ Facebook’s Nicola Mendelsohn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘It became clear, very quickly, that there would be different approaches to how people would talk about, debate and discuss the virus …’ Facebook’s Nicola Mendelsohn.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For a long time, the company had resisted acting on the problem. Moderation is hard enough already: simply finding and removing every example of unambiguously banned content on Facebook is a huge task, with comparatively easy-to-automate searches for things such as adult content still throwing up dizzying numbers of edge cases and errors. When it came to tackling misinformation, Facebook had a stated philosophical objection. “As a principle, in a democracy, I believe people should decide what is credible, not tech companies,” Zuckerberg told an audience at Georgetown University last year. But the company was also motivated by the fact that misinformation isn’t as straightforward to identify as nudity, graphic violence or even hate speech.</p> \n<p>For one thing, there isn’t even a commonly accepted definition. It is a sibling of disinformation, which is the deliberate spreading of falsehoods. But the line between “misinformation” and simple “inaccuracies” is blurry. Generally, the focus is on the potential for harm. A rumour that, say, the Canadian emo pop star Avril Lavigne was secretly replaced by a body double in the late 2000s is probably untrue, but unlikely to qualify as misinformation. Conversely, a rumour that Trump died of Covid-19 in early October and has been secretly replaced by a body double almost certainly does.</p> \n<p>But wherever the line is drawn, the problem is the same: to find out if something is misinformation, you need to know the truth. Were Facebook to ban it directly, the company would effectively need to run an entire journalistic enterprise within its own moderation team.</p> \n<p>As a compromise, Facebook partnered with journalists in 2017. Around the world, independent factchecking organisations were given funding and tools to mark viral posts on Facebook as true or false (there are a number of other categories, including “satirical”, “altered” or “missing context”). If the posts were false, their reach – the extent to which the Facebook algorithm showed them to others – would be diminished, and users would have to click through a warning sign to read them.</p> \n<p>So far, the programme has been a mixed success. Reducing the reach of false content certainly helps: just a few months after it was launched, Facebook said a factcheck would lead to 80% fewer viewers of a piece of false content. But factcheckers have complained about the limits placed on them by the social network, ranging from restrictions on their ability to factcheck political adverts to a lack of feedback from Facebook about how much, or little, their work is actually helping.</p> \n<p>And that was before Covid hit. “We went early as a company in closing down globally,” says Mendelsohn. “You would class us as conservative in that respect, and we will be conservative coming out as well.” Now, six months on, Facebook has a skeleton team in some of its offices and datacentres, and employees coming in to work on the company’s augmented and virtual reality products, such as its Oculus headsets. But the bulk of its staff are still working from home, something that Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/21/facebook-coronavirus-remote-working-policy-extended-years\">has said is likely to continue well past the end of the crisis</a>.</p> \n<p>Facebook’s moderation staff have been pulled off some of the most sensitive work, owing to data security concerns and fears for the employees’ own mental health. The soul-grinding task of scouring the platform for livestreamed suicides and videos of graphic violence has already led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/12/facebook-settlement-mental-health-moderators?ref=hvper.com\">a $52m settlement paid to more than 11,000 moderators in the US</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/04/ex-facebook-worker-claims-disturbing-content-led-to-ptsd\">a lawsuit in Ireland</a> over allegations of post-traumatic stress disorder, and that was when contractors were based in offices, with the support that brings.</p> \n<p>By early April, the company was having to bring its diminished resources to bear against some of the most viral misinformation it had ever seen. (The unfortunate double meaning of the world “viral” was noted by nearly everyone I interviewed for this piece, as was the cliched-yet-useful approach of modelling misinformation as something spreading like a disease.)</p> \n<p>“It became clear, very quickly, that there would be different approaches to how people would talk about, debate and discuss the issues of the virus,” Mendelsohn says. “And so we work through our harmful misinformation policy that we’ve had in place for about two and a half years now, where we have a very specific policy about taking down anything that could contribute to physical harm.”<strong> </strong></p> \n<p>Of course, the company has a lot of leeway in how it defines “physical harm”. It had applied that to infectious diseases before. A measles outbreak in Samoa, for instance, saw a parallel outbreak in harmful untruths, which Facebook acted to limit.<strong> </strong>But for years, Facebook has argued that the harm caused by the broader anti-vaccination movement didn’t cross that threshold, and allowed the groups to flourish on the platform. In March 2019, it relented slightly, and banned anti-vax ads that include misinformation about vaccines; in October this year, it went further, and banned all anti-vax advertising, except for that with a political message. “Organic content” – posts and groups advocating against vaccines – is still allowed.</p> \n<p>With Covid-19, the company went even further, attempting to limit the misinformation while also filling in the “information voids” that led people such as Philip down their dark path. Links pinned at the top of feeds have taken more than 2 billion people, Mendelsohn says, to resources from health authorities around the world, detailing what is known about the virus.</p> \n<p>But those efforts can’t stop the tide. “There was just an explosion of interest in one singular topic, for very obvious reasons,” says Tom Phillips, the editor-in-chief of Full Fact, one of Facebook’s two UK factchecking partners. “In the UK, we generally see massive spikes of traffic around elections, and we had one at the end of 2019. The pandemic dwarfed that.” And matching that explosion in interest was an explosion in the supply of misinformation, much of it delivered by questionable sources.</p> \n<p>“The industries that many celebrities work in – film, music, sport – were among the hardest hit by shutdowns. So even more than most of us, they suddenly found themselves with nothing to do but sit on Twitter,” Phillips says. “Not all of them did a Taylor Swift, spending the time recording an album. Some of them started sharing wild rumours to millions of followers instead.” This, then, is how we end up with Ian Brown, the former frontman of the Stone Roses, declaring that conspiracy theorist is “a term invented by the lame stream media to discredit those who can smell and see through the government/media lies and propaganda”.</p> \n<p>Brown’s obsession with revealing the “truth” about coronavirus has spread from his social-media posts to his recorded music: the anti-mask, anti-vaccine <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOHn6KurHE0&amp;feature=emb_title\">Little Seed Big Tree</a>, with lyrics including “Masonic lockdown, in your home town / Get behind your doors for the new world order” joins Van Morrison’s No More Lockdown (“No more taking of our freedom / And our God-given rights / Pretending it’s for our safety”) in the canon of hits championed by QAnon supporters.</p> \n<p>Where celebrities at least have a coterie of minders, publicists and agents begging them not to follow Brown and Morrison down this route, the rest of us had to rely on our friends and family, says QAnonCasualties’ Johnson. And then, suddenly, we couldn’t. “Some of these folk probably weren’t too into QAnon before the lockdown,” Johnson says. “They would have been shot down by co-workers when bringing it up.” Without that kind of reality check, they were able to fall further.</p> \n<p>Full Fact’s Phillips agrees. “Personal contact takes you out of the rabbit hole. You know, it can be a very direct, ‘No, mate, that’s nonsense,’ but it could also just be taking people away from the singular focus that conspiracy rabbit holes require. Just by introducing other topics of conversation.” Lockdown removed those opportunities for intervention at a stroke.</p> \n<p>And so, furloughed and stuck indoors, Rachel’s husband, Philip, sank deeper and deeper into the alternative reality that QAnon presented. Although Facebook had been the open end of the rabbit hole, it proved too restrictive for him: even the algorithmically mediated interactions with his friends and family were becoming hostile and argumentative, as they tried in vain to push back against the cult.</p> \n<p>He started new social media accounts, dedicated only to the conspiracy. When Rachel found one of those, and saw what it was sharing, she felt “physically sick”; she realised her husband hadn’t simply picked up a few odd beliefs, but joined a full-blown cult. “How do you talk to someone who has been brainwashed but who believes that it is <em>you</em> that is the brainwashed one,” she asked Reddit.</p> \n<p>In August, things hit rock bottom. Philip’s focus had grown from coronavirus-specific conspiracies to the wider web of evil posited by QAnon. His YouTube recommendations were no longer about mobile phones and cars; they were for clips putting forward conspiracy theories and fabrications. <strong> </strong>YouTube has historically been one of the most permissive of the major social media platforms, with few policies against misinformation: instead, the site puts links to Wikipedia pages underneath contentious videos (and deletes only the most egregiously false ones). But even YouTube’s filters started getting in the way, and so he switched again, to the video host BitChute, where “Fall of the Cabal”, a notorious QAnon video primer, shares space with content creators recounting lurid stories of having seen an infamous – yet entirely fictional – video of Hillary Clinton eating a young child alive, chasing a supposed high that can be gained from drinking the blood of a terrified child.</p> \n<p>In Philip’s eyes, Rachel was now an idiot, who believed mainstream media. “I became a ‘normie’ who needed to wake up and understand what was really going on,” she says. “He was unable to stick to one topic. If I said something about how we were struggling with social distancing at work, he would respond with a furious diatribe about Soros, Clinton, Bill Gates, 5G and vaccines that control and kill people.”</p> \n<p>For Rachel, the final straw was when her husband claimed to have seen a video incriminating a member of the Hollywood elite: a clip, he said, of Tom Hanks “with a three-year-old girl”. For Rachel, who works with safeguarded children, the implication was obscene. If her husband really had seen such a clip, then no matter how it was produced – Photoshopped, edited together – it must have started as real child abuse imagery. That a cult ostensibly focused on saving children could somehow persuade her husband to engage in sharing such material disgusted her. She started packing her bags the next morning.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>By the time QAnon adherents are that far in the rabbit hole, the consensus on the QAnonCasualties board is that it’s hard to rescue them. It’s not easy to overturn someone’s sense of reality, but even harder to restore it once it has been lost. And so the focus is on preventing people from falling down the rabbit hole in the first place: tackling QAnon at the more acceptable end.</p> \n<p>In the UK, that largely means the “Save the Children” movement, not to be confused with the charity of the same name. One of its largest groups, Freedom for the Children UK (FFTCUK), was created in July by Laura Ward, 36, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-54065470\">who told the BBC she</a> had a “spiritual awakening” that motivated her to organise during the lockdown. By late August, the FFTCUK Facebook page had become large enough to organise a 500-strong rally in central London, campaigning to “raise the awareness of child exploitation and human trafficking”. Ward denied any links to QAnon, but the London rally – one of 200<strong> </strong>nationwide that day – was full of QAnon-related slogans, from warnings that “pizzagate is real” to the catchphrase “Where we go one, we go all” (shortened to “WWG1WGA”).</p> \n<p>In October, Facebook announced a blanket ban on QAnon-related groups, after earlier trying to ban only those arms of the movement linked to violence. But that ban did not extend to groups such as FFTCUK, which remained on the site with more than 10,000 members. Joe Ondrak, of the factchecking site Logically, says the group’s denials don’t hold water. He cites the fact that members of the group openly talk about “adrenochrome harvesting” – the supposed high from drinking children’s blood. “While they don’t talk about Trump saving the world, the bedrock of their particular movement is based on one of QAnon’s many plotlines, rather than having any basis in reality,” Ondrak says.</p> \n<p>Shortly before this piece was published, Facebook finally took action to remove FFTCUK “for violating our dangerous individuals and organisations policy”. A spokesperson said: “In August, we expanded our dangerous individuals and organisations policy to address militarised social movements and violence-inducing conspiracy networks, such as QAnon. Since then, we’ve identified over 600 militarised social movements, removing about 2,400 pages, 14,200 groups and about 1,300 Instagram accounts they maintained, and in addition, we’ve removed about 1,700 pages, 5,600 groups and about 18,700 Instagram accounts representing QAnon.”</p> \n<p>The problem for Facebook is that the QAnon rabbit hole doesn’t work like other conspiracy theories. Rather than laying out the conspiracy, with a call to arms for believers, it instead offers a far more compelling instruction: “Do your research.”</p> \n<p>Adrian Hon, a game designer and founder of the developer Six to Start, describes the appeal as similar to that of an “alternate reality game”, or ARG.<strong> </strong>A relatively niche pursuit even in the geek circles where they flourish, ARGs can be thought of as large-scale communal puzzles, with clues and riddles often seeded across fake websites and real locations. They often involve the players working together to assemble evidence of a shadowy conspiracy, at a scale that no one person could hope to solve alone. The parallels, he feels, are obvious. “QAnon makes the act of ‘researching’ fun, and into a game. It is not a solitary effort where you are in your basement putting red string everywhere, and no one cares what you’re doing: you’re doing this in forums, on Facebook and WhatsApp. It is quite a social phenomenon.”</p> \n<p>QAnon is a group with coherent goals – ending child trafficking, or opposing Covid lockdowns – that prompt further questions. The adherents work together to uncover the truth beneath the surface, moving from mainstream sites to ever more esoteric communities, slowly getting sucked into the narrative they are both consuming and, ultimately, creating. “I know how people feel when they get into this,” Hon says. “It’s intoxicating and exciting to have all this information at your fingertips, and to be Googling things and checking websites.”</p> \n<p>That impulse doesn’t just pull in adherents. Those on the outside can find themselves equally intrigued by the complexity of QAnon-related beliefs. Abbie Richards, a graduate student of climate studies at Wageningen University &amp; Research in the Netherlands, found herself the target of QAnon-related attacks after she went viral on TikTok for, of all things, a video criticising golf courses.</p> \n<p>“You see all the comments in your videos, and I had one that was like: ‘Watch Fall of the Cabal, all 24 sections, and it’ll make sense,’” she says. “I was like, ‘You know what, I will!’” As she researched, what stood out was the ease with which the movement slid from things that were absolutely real to things that weren’t. In the eyes of the QAnon follower: “If Jeffrey Epstein’s death looks suspicious, then how can you deny that there’s a sex trafficking ring of people who drink blood?”</p> \n<p>Richards drew up a diagram, The Conspiracy Chart, exploring that slide in detail. At the bottom are things that actually happened – historical conspiracies such as the FBI’s Cointelpro operation, which aimed to destroy the civil rights movement in the 1960s. At the top, past “the antisemitic point of no return”, is the mesh of beliefs that characterise QAnon and its adherents. Initially posted on TikTok, the framework is a remarkably useful way of distinguishing between conspiracy theories, and the alternative realities that sit on top of them. (“God bless Abbie Richards,” says Full Fact’s Phillips, unprompted, when discussing the difficulty of defining QAnon.)</p> \n<p>But the chart also highlights, inadvertently, the difficulty of fighting the delusions head-on. As the conspiracies drift further away from the baseline of reality, the theorists are increasingly living in an altogether different world.</p> \n<p>In the sci-fi author Neal Stephenson’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/01/fall-or-dodge-in-hell-neal-stephenson-review-fantasy-wonder\">2019 novel </a>Fall; or, Dodge in Hell, a tech guru launches a misinformation attack on the world, releasing a fake video showing the destruction by a nuclear weapon of the small Utah town of Moab. The attack is quickly revealed as a hoax, but it doesn’t matter: 20 years later, “remember Moab” bumper stickers plaster cars as a cold civil war simmers. The consensus reality has broken down. Stephenson’s book feels prescient in an age when QAnon is mobilising marches of thousands of people against mass child abductions that aid workers say have simply not taken place. And, surprisingly, some experts, such as Ruth Ahnert, a professor at Queen Mary University of London and fellow of the Alan Turing Institute, which conducts research into artificial intelligence and data science, think we have been here before.</p> \n<p>Ahnert acknowledges that Facebook and other social media platforms have changed the way we get information, but disputes that consensus reality is only now breaking down. “I think that idea is true only if you think of the movement from the 20th century to the 21st century, from broadcast media to social media. If you look in the longer history – back to the 16th century – you see something that looks like now.”</p> \n<p>She says that then, as now, the elites had access to fairly accurate information about the state of the world. “If you look at the really influential people, those people had huge reach. They were communicating across Europe, into north Africa, into South America, Ottoman empire, sub-Saharan Africa.” Think of Samuel Pepys, as administrator of the navy, able to request and receive a report on the local conditions from almost anywhere English ships sailed. “But normal people were probably not communicating much beyond their village,” Ahnert points out. And, in an era when people primarily get their news from social networks – as more than one in 10 British adults do, <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0027/157914/uk-news-consumption-2019-report.pdf\">according to Ofcom</a> – then all that has happened is the village has moved online.</p> \n<p>In that long view, the artificial world isn’t the one the internet and lockdown have created, but the temporary “blip” in time when broadcast media was able to forge one shared reality for a nation. “I wonder if it’s kind of come full circle in a way,” Ahnert says. “The more information we have access to, the less ability we have to tell what is authentic or not.”</p> \n<p>When I put Ahnert’s words to Facebook’s chief product officer, Chris Cox, he is, unsurprisingly, less pessimistic. “I don’t think we’re going back to the stone age here, but I do think, like with each medium, we go through a reckoning when it’s born; [a process] of understanding it and integrating it into our lives. Facebook was built in 2004, so I guess technically we’re still a teenager.”</p> \n<p>He points out that for Facebook, the work is continuing. “When we study groups, for example, we are able to study which of those are harmful and take a stand on them. And which of those are creating, at least at the individual level, a sense of deep belonging, fulfilling a deep need.”</p> \n<p>We aren’t fully living in an online village yet. The number of people who get their news from a large, trusted provider still vastly outweighs those who focus primarily on social media; three times as many British people say BBC One is their single most important news source as those who cite Facebook. But Facebook is in third place, just behind ITV, and its share is growing.</p> \n<p>“We take our responsibility very, very seriously,” says Facebook’s Mendelsohn. “It’s interesting to think about the history of misinformation, because it has been around for ever. It is in the nature of human beings.”</p> \n<p>Rachel has a more concrete suggestion for how to reverse the tide. “QAnon seems to turn people into angry, bitter, volatile people. Offering kindness, and reminding yourself of who they really are, helps. It is a mental health issue.”</p> \n<p>When she confronted her husband about the Hanks video, and started making preparations to leave, it shocked him back to reality. Philip came to her, saying he had deleted everything QAnon-related<strong> </strong>from his phone, as well as his social media accounts. “I do love you,” he said.</p> \n<p>It has been a long road to recovery. Philip admitted that he hadn’t seen the Hanks video, but a still image that was “definitely him”. Two days later, he and Rachel went shopping, and he wore a face covering for the first time, something he had previously insisted was just another example of how “they” were controlling the “sheep”. Since then, Rachel says, “we’ve racked up more than 1,000 miles in the car, driving all over England to visit beautiful, quiet places to walk and talked like there is no tomorrow.</p> \n<p>“I reminded him of how we laughed like drains when Trump was elected in 2016 and wondered if the US had lost its collective mind. He laughed and agreed. He still believes there might be a deep state or something sinister like that, but is now thinking more about questioning the motives of the people who are doing the pointing – not who they are pointing at.</p> \n<p>“I am glad I stuck my hand down the rabbit hole and hauled him out,” she says. “Although I suspect that I am going to be dusting the rabbit droppings off him for a long time.”</p> \n<p>• This article was amended on 11 November 2020. An earlier version said that Facebook had yet to extend its ban “to groups such as FFTCUK”. In fact, that group was banned on 10 November 2020, shortly before the article’s publication; the piece was updated to reflect this and a statement from Facebook added.</p>",

          "bodyText": "As with many others in Britain, lockdown hit Rachel and her husband, Philip, hard. Almost overnight, the couple, both in their early 50s, found themselves cut off from friends, family and colleagues. Before the Covid-19 outbreak, they had both been working every day; now Philip found himself furloughed, while Rachel was put on rotation with other essential staff, working fewer shifts at odd hours. They were unable to meet up with their four adult sons and daughters. They had to attend a family funeral while remaining socially distanced. Initially, Rachel coped in the way many others did. She played more video games than normal, and felt stressed at work, but as far as possible she managed. Her husband didn’t. For him, it seemed there must be more to it than the authorities struggling to cope with a novel virus and evolving expert advice. “The regularly changing and conflicting information that was coming from the government added to the feeling in him that they were making things up or covering something up,” Rachel says now. Initially, Philip and Rachel (their names have been changed for this article) discussed his fears, but as lockdown went on, their conversations stopped. Philip was frustrated that Rachel wasn’t taking his concerns seriously: someone had to be benefiting from the situation, he insisted, and events such as Dominic Cummings’ Barnard Castle “eye test” only increased his belief that “they” knew the pandemic was fake, and the nation was being kept indoors for a more sinister purpose. Philip began to research what this sinister purpose might be. That, Rachel says, is what led him to QAnon. It’s hard to describe the movement that Philip fell into. QAnon has its roots in the “pizzagate” conspiracy, which emerged four years ago after users poring over hacked Democratic party emails on the message board 4chan said that, if you replaced the word “pizza” with “little girl”, it looked as if they were discussing eating children. That claim – whether it was made in jest or sincerity is impossible to tell – spiralled into allegations of a vast paedophilic conspiracy centred on Comet Pizza, a restaurant in Washington DC. A year later, a 4chan user with the handle “Q Clearance Patriot” appeared, claiming to be a government insider tasked with sharing “crumbs” of intel about Donald Trump’s planned counter-coup against the deep state forces frustrating his presidency. As Q’s following grew, the movement became known as the Storm – as in, “the calm before …” – and then QAnon, after its founder and prophet. At that point, QAnon was a relatively understandable conspiracy theory: it had a clear set of beliefs rooted in support for Trump and in the increasingly cryptic posts attributed to Q (by then widely believed to be a group of people posting under one name). Now, though, it’s less clearcut. There’s no one set of beliefs that define a QAnon adherent. Most will claim some form of mass paedophilic conspiracy; some, particularly in the US, continue to focus on Trump’s supposed fightback. But the web of beliefs has become all-encompassing. One fan-produced map of all the “revelations” linked to the group includes references to Julius Caesar, Atlantis and the pharaohs of Egypt in one corner, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and 5G in another, the knights of Malta in a third, and the Fukushima meltdown in a fourth – all tied together with a generous helping of antisemitism, from the Protocols of the Elders of Zion to hatred of George Soros. QAnon isn’t one conspiracy theory any more: it’s all of them at once. In September, BuzzFeed News made the stylistic decision to refer to the movement as a “collective delusion”. “There’s more to the convoluted entity than the average reader might realise,” wrote BuzzFeed’s Drusilla Moorhouse and Emerson Malone. “But delusion does illustrate the reality better than conspiracy theory does. We are discussing a mass of people who subscribe to a shared set of values and debunked ideas, which inform their beliefs and actions.” At first, QAnon was a largely US phenomenon, with limited penetration in the UK. The pandemic, however, has changed that. According to recent polling by Hope Not Hate, one in four people in Britain now agree with some of the basic conspiracies it has promulgated: that “secret satanic cults exist and include influential elites”, and that “elites in Hollywood, politics, the media” are secretly engaging in large-scale child trafficking and abuse. Nearly a third believe there is “a single group of people who secretly control events and rule the world together”, and almost a fifth say that Covid-19 was intentionally released as part of a “depopulation plan”. For Philip, trapped at home and searching for an explanation for a global pandemic, when all he could find was a void of information, QAnon was fertile territory. He already spent most of his time while furloughed on his phone looking for answers. What was the real reason for everyone being forced inside? How did the virus start? Who started it? “In his mind, there had to be a reason for it,” Rachel says. Inevitably, his search took in Facebook, where the site’s recommendation algorithms were quick to connect him to individuals on similar quests. “Ultimately, it led to him becoming brainwashed,” she says. For many, the existence of Facebook – and its sister products, including WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger – has been a lifeline in this period. The social network has always prided itself on connecting people, and when the ability to socialise in person, or even leave the house, was curtailed, Facebook was there to pick up the slack. But those same services have also enabled the creation of what one professional factchecker calls a “perfect storm for misinformation”. And with real-life interaction suppressed to counter the spread of the virus, it’s easier than ever for people to fall deep down a rabbit hole of deception, where the endpoint may not simply be a decline in vaccination rates or the election of an unpleasant president, but the end of consensus reality as we know it. What happens when your basic understanding of the world is no longer the same as your neighbour’s? And can Facebook stop that fate coming to us all? * * * Since its foundation, in Mark Zuckerberg’s Harvard dorm room, Facebook has tackled its share of challenges. Some have stayed fairly constant: no social network gets many users without needing to tackle spam, for instance, though the Facebook of 2004 would struggle to remove the 3.3bn junk posts that the company took down in the first half of this year. Others are unique to a company with 2.7 billion users that operates in almost every country in the world. Facebook has become a centre point of civil society. It’s more than just a place to share photos and plan parties: it’s where people read news, arrange protests, engage in debate, play games and watch bands. And that means that all the problems of civil society are now problems for Facebook: bullying, sexual abuse, political polarisation and conspiracy theorists all existed before the social network, but all took on new contours as they moved online. And this year they really moved online. As the initial lockdown was imposed across much of the world, people’s relationship to the internet, and to Facebook in particular, evolved rapidly. Stuck socially distancing, people turned to social networking to fill an emotional void. Suddenly, the company found itself staring at unprecedented demands. “Our busiest time of the year is New Year’s Eve,” says Nicola Mendelsohn, Facebook’s vice-president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, over a Zoom call from her London home. “And we were seeing the equivalent of New Year’s Eve every single day.” It was, she says, the inevitable result of having “almost the entire planet at home at the same time”. Rachel agrees. “I believe the lockdown played a huge part in altering people’s perception of reality,” she says. When Covid restrictions came in, the rules of social interaction were rewritten. We suddenly stopped meeting friends in pubs, at the coffee point or by the school gates, and our lives moved online. And for many of us, “online” meant “on Facebook”. I first heard Rachel’s story from QAnonCasualties, a forum on the social news site Reddit where she, and thousands like her, have congregated to seek advice and support after their loved ones fell into the cult. Her first post, in July this year, was titled: “I’ve finally reached the end of my tether.” She described a marriage of 25 years, and a family with four grownup children, being shattered by a husband who had sunk “further and further into this conspiracy”. “It’s got the stage where I no longer understand him or even recognise him,” she wrote. Others echoed her story. Posts with titles such as “Grieving my dad while he’s still alive” and “Today I filed for divorce from my QAnon-obsessed husband” rub shoulders with pleas for help from those who still hope they can win loved ones back. Beyond the heartbreak and anguish on QAnonCasualties, there is a common thread: a feeling that their friends and relatives are inhabiting a different reality. “On all levels, from the old-school conspiracist who just wants to uncover corruption to the alien interdimensional vampire demon QAnon believer, they ignore reality and latch on to narratives that support their version of reality,” says Robert Johnson, one of the moderators of the board, adding that most of the recent posts are from people radicalised in lockdown. Early on in the pandemic, Facebook moved to make the most of the situation. As almost all of its 50,000 or so employees, as well as its army of contractors, were sent home, and Zuckerberg talked up the benefits of remote working, the company handed out grants to small businesses to help them switch to digital operation – $100m (£79m) globally, and another $100m in the US – and retooled its product offerings to take advantage of the new normal. But for all the work it put into smoothing the transition to lockdown life, Facebook also knew it had a problem brewing. The company’s never-ending battle with misinformation on its platforms was about to step into overdrive. For a long time, the company had resisted acting on the problem. Moderation is hard enough already: simply finding and removing every example of unambiguously banned content on Facebook is a huge task, with comparatively easy-to-automate searches for things such as adult content still throwing up dizzying numbers of edge cases and errors. When it came to tackling misinformation, Facebook had a stated philosophical objection. “As a principle, in a democracy, I believe people should decide what is credible, not tech companies,” Zuckerberg told an audience at Georgetown University last year. But the company was also motivated by the fact that misinformation isn’t as straightforward to identify as nudity, graphic violence or even hate speech. For one thing, there isn’t even a commonly accepted definition. It is a sibling of disinformation, which is the deliberate spreading of falsehoods. But the line between “misinformation” and simple “inaccuracies” is blurry. Generally, the focus is on the potential for harm. A rumour that, say, the Canadian emo pop star Avril Lavigne was secretly replaced by a body double in the late 2000s is probably untrue, but unlikely to qualify as misinformation. Conversely, a rumour that Trump died of Covid-19 in early October and has been secretly replaced by a body double almost certainly does. But wherever the line is drawn, the problem is the same: to find out if something is misinformation, you need to know the truth. Were Facebook to ban it directly, the company would effectively need to run an entire journalistic enterprise within its own moderation team. As a compromise, Facebook partnered with journalists in 2017. Around the world, independent factchecking organisations were given funding and tools to mark viral posts on Facebook as true or false (there are a number of other categories, including “satirical”, “altered” or “missing context”). If the posts were false, their reach – the extent to which the Facebook algorithm showed them to others – would be diminished, and users would have to click through a warning sign to read them. So far, the programme has been a mixed success. Reducing the reach of false content certainly helps: just a few months after it was launched, Facebook said a factcheck would lead to 80% fewer viewers of a piece of false content. But factcheckers have complained about the limits placed on them by the social network, ranging from restrictions on their ability to factcheck political adverts to a lack of feedback from Facebook about how much, or little, their work is actually helping. And that was before Covid hit. “We went early as a company in closing down globally,” says Mendelsohn. “You would class us as conservative in that respect, and we will be conservative coming out as well.” Now, six months on, Facebook has a skeleton team in some of its offices and datacentres, and employees coming in to work on the company’s augmented and virtual reality products, such as its Oculus headsets. But the bulk of its staff are still working from home, something that Zuckerberg has said is likely to continue well past the end of the crisis. Facebook’s moderation staff have been pulled off some of the most sensitive work, owing to data security concerns and fears for the employees’ own mental health. The soul-grinding task of scouring the platform for livestreamed suicides and videos of graphic violence has already led to a $52m settlement paid to more than 11,000 moderators in the US, and a lawsuit in Ireland over allegations of post-traumatic stress disorder, and that was when contractors were based in offices, with the support that brings. By early April, the company was having to bring its diminished resources to bear against some of the most viral misinformation it had ever seen. (The unfortunate double meaning of the world “viral” was noted by nearly everyone I interviewed for this piece, as was the cliched-yet-useful approach of modelling misinformation as something spreading like a disease.) “It became clear, very quickly, that there would be different approaches to how people would talk about, debate and discuss the issues of the virus,” Mendelsohn says. “And so we work through our harmful misinformation policy that we’ve had in place for about two and a half years now, where we have a very specific policy about taking down anything that could contribute to physical harm.” Of course, the company has a lot of leeway in how it defines “physical harm”. It had applied that to infectious diseases before. A measles outbreak in Samoa, for instance, saw a parallel outbreak in harmful untruths, which Facebook acted to limit. But for years, Facebook has argued that the harm caused by the broader anti-vaccination movement didn’t cross that threshold, and allowed the groups to flourish on the platform. In March 2019, it relented slightly, and banned anti-vax ads that include misinformation about vaccines; in October this year, it went further, and banned all anti-vax advertising, except for that with a political message. “Organic content” – posts and groups advocating against vaccines – is still allowed. With Covid-19, the company went even further, attempting to limit the misinformation while also filling in the “information voids” that led people such as Philip down their dark path. Links pinned at the top of feeds have taken more than 2 billion people, Mendelsohn says, to resources from health authorities around the world, detailing what is known about the virus. But those efforts can’t stop the tide. “There was just an explosion of interest in one singular topic, for very obvious reasons,” says Tom Phillips, the editor-in-chief of Full Fact, one of Facebook’s two UK factchecking partners. “In the UK, we generally see massive spikes of traffic around elections, and we had one at the end of 2019. The pandemic dwarfed that.” And matching that explosion in interest was an explosion in the supply of misinformation, much of it delivered by questionable sources. “The industries that many celebrities work in – film, music, sport – were among the hardest hit by shutdowns. So even more than most of us, they suddenly found themselves with nothing to do but sit on Twitter,” Phillips says. “Not all of them did a Taylor Swift, spending the time recording an album. Some of them started sharing wild rumours to millions of followers instead.” This, then, is how we end up with Ian Brown, the former frontman of the Stone Roses, declaring that conspiracy theorist is “a term invented by the lame stream media to discredit those who can smell and see through the government/media lies and propaganda”. Brown’s obsession with revealing the “truth” about coronavirus has spread from his social-media posts to his recorded music: the anti-mask, anti-vaccine Little Seed Big Tree, with lyrics including “Masonic lockdown, in your home town / Get behind your doors for the new world order” joins Van Morrison’s No More Lockdown (“No more taking of our freedom / And our God-given rights / Pretending it’s for our safety”) in the canon of hits championed by QAnon supporters. Where celebrities at least have a coterie of minders, publicists and agents begging them not to follow Brown and Morrison down this route, the rest of us had to rely on our friends and family, says QAnonCasualties’ Johnson. And then, suddenly, we couldn’t. “Some of these folk probably weren’t too into QAnon before the lockdown,” Johnson says. “They would have been shot down by co-workers when bringing it up.” Without that kind of reality check, they were able to fall further. Full Fact’s Phillips agrees. “Personal contact takes you out of the rabbit hole. You know, it can be a very direct, ‘No, mate, that’s nonsense,’ but it could also just be taking people away from the singular focus that conspiracy rabbit holes require. Just by introducing other topics of conversation.” Lockdown removed those opportunities for intervention at a stroke. And so, furloughed and stuck indoors, Rachel’s husband, Philip, sank deeper and deeper into the alternative reality that QAnon presented. Although Facebook had been the open end of the rabbit hole, it proved too restrictive for him: even the algorithmically mediated interactions with his friends and family were becoming hostile and argumentative, as they tried in vain to push back against the cult. He started new social media accounts, dedicated only to the conspiracy. When Rachel found one of those, and saw what it was sharing, she felt “physically sick”; she realised her husband hadn’t simply picked up a few odd beliefs, but joined a full-blown cult. “How do you talk to someone who has been brainwashed but who believes that it is you that is the brainwashed one,” she asked Reddit. In August, things hit rock bottom. Philip’s focus had grown from coronavirus-specific conspiracies to the wider web of evil posited by QAnon. His YouTube recommendations were no longer about mobile phones and cars; they were for clips putting forward conspiracy theories and fabrications. YouTube has historically been one of the most permissive of the major social media platforms, with few policies against misinformation: instead, the site puts links to Wikipedia pages underneath contentious videos (and deletes only the most egregiously false ones). But even YouTube’s filters started getting in the way, and so he switched again, to the video host BitChute, where “Fall of the Cabal”, a notorious QAnon video primer, shares space with content creators recounting lurid stories of having seen an infamous – yet entirely fictional – video of Hillary Clinton eating a young child alive, chasing a supposed high that can be gained from drinking the blood of a terrified child. In Philip’s eyes, Rachel was now an idiot, who believed mainstream media. “I became a ‘normie’ who needed to wake up and understand what was really going on,” she says. “He was unable to stick to one topic. If I said something about how we were struggling with social distancing at work, he would respond with a furious diatribe about Soros, Clinton, Bill Gates, 5G and vaccines that control and kill people.” For Rachel, the final straw was when her husband claimed to have seen a video incriminating a member of the Hollywood elite: a clip, he said, of Tom Hanks “with a three-year-old girl”. For Rachel, who works with safeguarded children, the implication was obscene. If her husband really had seen such a clip, then no matter how it was produced – Photoshopped, edited together – it must have started as real child abuse imagery. That a cult ostensibly focused on saving children could somehow persuade her husband to engage in sharing such material disgusted her. She started packing her bags the next morning. * * * By the time QAnon adherents are that far in the rabbit hole, the consensus on the QAnonCasualties board is that it’s hard to rescue them. It’s not easy to overturn someone’s sense of reality, but even harder to restore it once it has been lost. And so the focus is on preventing people from falling down the rabbit hole in the first place: tackling QAnon at the more acceptable end. In the UK, that largely means the “Save the Children” movement, not to be confused with the charity of the same name. One of its largest groups, Freedom for the Children UK (FFTCUK), was created in July by Laura Ward, 36, who told the BBC she had a “spiritual awakening” that motivated her to organise during the lockdown. By late August, the FFTCUK Facebook page had become large enough to organise a 500-strong rally in central London, campaigning to “raise the awareness of child exploitation and human trafficking”. Ward denied any links to QAnon, but the London rally – one of 200 nationwide that day – was full of QAnon-related slogans, from warnings that “pizzagate is real” to the catchphrase “Where we go one, we go all” (shortened to “WWG1WGA”). In October, Facebook announced a blanket ban on QAnon-related groups, after earlier trying to ban only those arms of the movement linked to violence. But that ban did not extend to groups such as FFTCUK, which remained on the site with more than 10,000 members. Joe Ondrak, of the factchecking site Logically, says the group’s denials don’t hold water. He cites the fact that members of the group openly talk about “adrenochrome harvesting” – the supposed high from drinking children’s blood. “While they don’t talk about Trump saving the world, the bedrock of their particular movement is based on one of QAnon’s many plotlines, rather than having any basis in reality,” Ondrak says. Shortly before this piece was published, Facebook finally took action to remove FFTCUK “for violating our dangerous individuals and organisations policy”. A spokesperson said: “In August, we expanded our dangerous individuals and organisations policy to address militarised social movements and violence-inducing conspiracy networks, such as QAnon. Since then, we’ve identified over 600 militarised social movements, removing about 2,400 pages, 14,200 groups and about 1,300 Instagram accounts they maintained, and in addition, we’ve removed about 1,700 pages, 5,600 groups and about 18,700 Instagram accounts representing QAnon.” The problem for Facebook is that the QAnon rabbit hole doesn’t work like other conspiracy theories. Rather than laying out the conspiracy, with a call to arms for believers, it instead offers a far more compelling instruction: “Do your research.” Adrian Hon, a game designer and founder of the developer Six to Start, describes the appeal as similar to that of an “alternate reality game”, or ARG. A relatively niche pursuit even in the geek circles where they flourish, ARGs can be thought of as large-scale communal puzzles, with clues and riddles often seeded across fake websites and real locations. They often involve the players working together to assemble evidence of a shadowy conspiracy, at a scale that no one person could hope to solve alone. The parallels, he feels, are obvious. “QAnon makes the act of ‘researching’ fun, and into a game. It is not a solitary effort where you are in your basement putting red string everywhere, and no one cares what you’re doing: you’re doing this in forums, on Facebook and WhatsApp. It is quite a social phenomenon.” QAnon is a group with coherent goals – ending child trafficking, or opposing Covid lockdowns – that prompt further questions. The adherents work together to uncover the truth beneath the surface, moving from mainstream sites to ever more esoteric communities, slowly getting sucked into the narrative they are both consuming and, ultimately, creating. “I know how people feel when they get into this,” Hon says. “It’s intoxicating and exciting to have all this information at your fingertips, and to be Googling things and checking websites.” That impulse doesn’t just pull in adherents. Those on the outside can find themselves equally intrigued by the complexity of QAnon-related beliefs. Abbie Richards, a graduate student of climate studies at Wageningen University &amp; Research in the Netherlands, found herself the target of QAnon-related attacks after she went viral on TikTok for, of all things, a video criticising golf courses. “You see all the comments in your videos, and I had one that was like: ‘Watch Fall of the Cabal, all 24 sections, and it’ll make sense,’” she says. “I was like, ‘You know what, I will!’” As she researched, what stood out was the ease with which the movement slid from things that were absolutely real to things that weren’t. In the eyes of the QAnon follower: “If Jeffrey Epstein’s death looks suspicious, then how can you deny that there’s a sex trafficking ring of people who drink blood?” Richards drew up a diagram, The Conspiracy Chart, exploring that slide in detail. At the bottom are things that actually happened – historical conspiracies such as the FBI’s Cointelpro operation, which aimed to destroy the civil rights movement in the 1960s. At the top, past “the antisemitic point of no return”, is the mesh of beliefs that characterise QAnon and its adherents. Initially posted on TikTok, the framework is a remarkably useful way of distinguishing between conspiracy theories, and the alternative realities that sit on top of them. (“God bless Abbie Richards,” says Full Fact’s Phillips, unprompted, when discussing the difficulty of defining QAnon.) But the chart also highlights, inadvertently, the difficulty of fighting the delusions head-on. As the conspiracies drift further away from the baseline of reality, the theorists are increasingly living in an altogether different world. In the sci-fi author Neal Stephenson’s 2019 novel Fall; or, Dodge in Hell, a tech guru launches a misinformation attack on the world, releasing a fake video showing the destruction by a nuclear weapon of the small Utah town of Moab. The attack is quickly revealed as a hoax, but it doesn’t matter: 20 years later, “remember Moab” bumper stickers plaster cars as a cold civil war simmers. The consensus reality has broken down. Stephenson’s book feels prescient in an age when QAnon is mobilising marches of thousands of people against mass child abductions that aid workers say have simply not taken place. And, surprisingly, some experts, such as Ruth Ahnert, a professor at Queen Mary University of London and fellow of the Alan Turing Institute, which conducts research into artificial intelligence and data science, think we have been here before. Ahnert acknowledges that Facebook and other social media platforms have changed the way we get information, but disputes that consensus reality is only now breaking down. “I think that idea is true only if you think of the movement from the 20th century to the 21st century, from broadcast media to social media. If you look in the longer history – back to the 16th century – you see something that looks like now.” She says that then, as now, the elites had access to fairly accurate information about the state of the world. “If you look at the really influential people, those people had huge reach. They were communicating across Europe, into north Africa, into South America, Ottoman empire, sub-Saharan Africa.” Think of Samuel Pepys, as administrator of the navy, able to request and receive a report on the local conditions from almost anywhere English ships sailed. “But normal people were probably not communicating much beyond their village,” Ahnert points out. And, in an era when people primarily get their news from social networks – as more than one in 10 British adults do, according to Ofcom – then all that has happened is the village has moved online. In that long view, the artificial world isn’t the one the internet and lockdown have created, but the temporary “blip” in time when broadcast media was able to forge one shared reality for a nation. “I wonder if it’s kind of come full circle in a way,” Ahnert says. “The more information we have access to, the less ability we have to tell what is authentic or not.” When I put Ahnert’s words to Facebook’s chief product officer, Chris Cox, he is, unsurprisingly, less pessimistic. “I don’t think we’re going back to the stone age here, but I do think, like with each medium, we go through a reckoning when it’s born; [a process] of understanding it and integrating it into our lives. Facebook was built in 2004, so I guess technically we’re still a teenager.” He points out that for Facebook, the work is continuing. “When we study groups, for example, we are able to study which of those are harmful and take a stand on them. And which of those are creating, at least at the individual level, a sense of deep belonging, fulfilling a deep need.” We aren’t fully living in an online village yet. The number of people who get their news from a large, trusted provider still vastly outweighs those who focus primarily on social media; three times as many British people say BBC One is their single most important news source as those who cite Facebook. But Facebook is in third place, just behind ITV, and its share is growing. “We take our responsibility very, very seriously,” says Facebook’s Mendelsohn. “It’s interesting to think about the history of misinformation, because it has been around for ever. It is in the nature of human beings.” Rachel has a more concrete suggestion for how to reverse the tide. “QAnon seems to turn people into angry, bitter, volatile people. Offering kindness, and reminding yourself of who they really are, helps. It is a mental health issue.” When she confronted her husband about the Hanks video, and started making preparations to leave, it shocked him back to reality. Philip came to her, saying he had deleted everything QAnon-related from his phone, as well as his social media accounts. “I do love you,” he said. It has been a long road to recovery. Philip admitted that he hadn’t seen the Hanks video, but a still image that was “definitely him”. Two days later, he and Rachel went shopping, and he wore a face covering for the first time, something he had previously insisted was just another example of how “they” were controlling the “sheep”. Since then, Rachel says, “we’ve racked up more than 1,000 miles in the car, driving all over England to visit beautiful, quiet places to walk and talked like there is no tomorrow. “I reminded him of how we laughed like drains when Trump was elected in 2016 and wondered if the US had lost its collective mind. He laughed and agreed. He still believes there might be a deep state or something sinister like that, but is now thinking more about questioning the motives of the people who are doing the pointing – not who they are pointing at. “I am glad I stuck my hand down the rabbit hole and hauled him out,” she says. “Although I suspect that I am going to be dusting the rabbit droppings off him for a long time.” • This article was amended on 11 November 2020. An earlier version said that Facebook had yet to extend its ban “to groups such as FFTCUK”. In fact, that group was banned on 10 November 2020, shortly before the article’s publication; the piece was updated to reflect this and a statement from Facebook added.",

          "body": "<p>On a gloomy afternoon in a Sussex wood, a 21st-century superhero appears. Dressed in black, helmeted, a pack on his back and jets on his arms, he rises to a couple of metres above the ground, accelerates up above a grassy bank and then hovers in a swirling cloud of autumn leaves.</p> \n<p>No matter how many times you’ve watched a video on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy1BqteDyaI\" title=\"\">YouTube</a>, nothing can quite prepare you for the sight of a human being in flight. It is the embodiment of a thousand myths, from Hermes and Peter Pan to Iron Man, as well as a million childhood dreams, and is the only correct answer to that old conundrum: which superpower would you choose, invisibility or flying? If it wasn’t for the roar of the jet engines and the smell of fuel, you would assume it was just a dream.</p> \n<p>Back on Earth, jets silent, helmet off, the superhero reveals himself. Not Clark Kent or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/06/next-iron-man-black-woman-marvel-comic-riri-williams\" title=\"\">Tony Stark</a>, but Richard Browning, 41, a former oil trader, now entrepreneur, innovator, flyer. “It is the most joyous, free, kind-of-dreamlike state,” he says, of the experience. “When you’re riding a bike, you’re not thinking about turning the handlebars or keeping your balance, you’re just thinking: I’m going to cycle that way. Imagine that in three-dimensional space, being entirely free to move and go wherever you like.”</p> \n<p>Articulate, confident, quite intense, it’s no surprise to learn that while he was making loadsamoney in the City, Browning also spent six years in the Royal Marines reserves. (Although his earlier decision not to take up officer training at Sandhurst perhaps had something to do with his preference for ripping up the rulebook rather than following it.)</p> \n<p>Going back a little further, Browning has aviation, innovation and jet fuel in his blood. One grandfather was a wartime and civil pilot, while the other used to run Westland Helicopters. Browning’s father was an aeronautical engineer, maverick inventor and designer. As a kid, Richard made and flew balsawood gliders with his dad.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"56cfbe72666154f087560899b2ca703906bbc2df\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56cfbe72666154f087560899b2ca703906bbc2df/0_283_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Armed and dangerous?

I had this belief that if you just add the missing component of horsepower, you could fly in a very different way.”</p> \n<p>Add horsepower is what he did. Four years ago, he got hold of a micro gas turbine, plus another, strapped them to his arms and hopped up and down in a field. Then he got a couple more, hopped a little higher, added more turbines, fell over a lot … and eventually flew. “There was no business reason, no logic, I just thought it would be fun,” he says.</p> \n<p>There was also, he now realises, a deeply personal reason. Despite leaving his day job to pursue his inventions, Browning’s dad was unable to make money from them and, in despair, killed himself when his son was 15. “The journey, I realise in hindsight, is very much one of fulfilling some unfulfilled ambition. My father is just one of thousands of people who has an idea, tries to take it over the line. It doesn’t work out and ultimately it cost him his life. I grew up through that. Now I blatantly like taking on new challenges and trying to get them over the line, probably to make good on what I didn’t quite see happen when I was a kid.”</p> \n<p>His dad would love what he is doing, he says. But what is he doing? What is the point of it all? “The main thing, crass as it may sound, is entertainment.”</p> \n<p>Browning and his company Gravity Industries, now a multimillion-dollar organisation with investment from people such as the Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper, do flying displays at events – the opening of a baseball stadium in Japan, for example, or a car launch in China. They are planning a race series, though that has been put on hold by the pandemic. And they do training days here at Goodwood. At £6,000 a pop, the wealthy can come and have a go, albeit tied to a leash to prevent any unplanned Icarus incidents.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a89f5b2c08cf731c7be156814a1d38887eed69da\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a89f5b2c08cf731c7be156814a1d38887eed69da/11_0_3978_2389/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lifesaver?

Gravity Industries founder Richard Browning flies in Langdale, Cumbria, to a simulated casualty site near Bowfell.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gravity Industries/YouTube/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He thinks the times – Covid, Brexit, Trump – have helped to fuel public interest, that it’s about “the metaphor of breaking free, being weightless and unbound, going for the skies and the stars. I don’t think people are consciously aware of that but I think it represents that.”</p> \n<p>Browning isn’t the only one taking to the skies. This year, someone with a jetpack <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-54004695\" title=\"\">flew around LAX</a> airport in Los Angeles. Frenchman Franky Zapata crossed the Channel last year<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2019/aug/04/franky-zapata-french-inventor-crosses-channel-by-hoverboard-video\" title=\"\"> on his jet-powered hoverboard</a>. And a US company, JetPack Aviation, boasts that it can fly a person to 15,000ft (4,600 metres).</p> \n<p>You might think the skies are soon going to fill up with people buzzing around, but (perhaps luckily for the environment) Browning says jetpacks are some way from becoming mainstream transport. “I never developed it with that in mind. I set out on this journey purely with the idea of having some fun with something that conventional wisdom said was impossible.”</p> \n<p>Remember, though, that the first motorcars were considered noisy, unreliable and dangerous – hugely inferior, technologically, to the horse. “I’m not running around telling everyone there’s going to be a revolution tomorrow,” Browning says. “We’re just going to enjoy the journey and see where it gets to.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"56aee133-08df-46a4-81b7-c5ba629e8857\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5-Hiy6KvURI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Which isn’t to say he doesn’t hold out hope. “You can imagine, with safe and high-energy-density battery storage at 10 times what gasoline, diesel and jet fuel can do, an electric hover suit that can be automatically managed so it does not go more than three or four metres high and an airbag deployment system that makes it entirely safe, the equivalent of going for a bike ride.”</p> \n<p>It seems that practical applications may already be here. Browning says his company is talking with both the UK and US militaries. “I’ll say there is a very healthy collaboration. There is a niche special forces application. If you’ve got to get a human anywhere within a three or four kilometre radius of here, over minefields, through earthquake disaster zones, round forests, over rivers, I don’t care if it’s night or if there is a storm blowing, I can start up with the latest version of this in 10 seconds and be there.”</p> \n<p>Ambulance crews in the Lake District could soon be joined by <a href=\"https://www.greatnorthairambulance.co.uk/our-work/how-we-do-it/leading-innovation/jet-suit/\" title=\"\">jetsuit paramedics, after a recent trial</a> showed they could reach an injured walker or climber in a fraction of the time that a traditional mountain rescue team would require.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3c4c8da2a7d8f2fd7801ee5f7bb1fe7a1c57c08c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c4c8da2a7d8f2fd7801ee5f7bb1fe7a1c57c08c/0_508_2774_2996/926.jpg\" alt=\"Sean Connery gets to grips with a jetpack in the 1965 James Bond film Thunderball.\" width=\"926\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Licensed to fly ...

He makes the analogy of a city motorbike paramedic. A jetpack won’t take you to hospital, but it will get a trained person to your side quickly, to sort out breathing, blood flow or pain.</p> \n<p>He has already done a day’s training and the service is in serious discussions with Gravity about how to make the dream reality. “It’s a possibility we could see this late summer next year,” he says.</p> \n<p>Back in the marginally less challenging terrain of the South Downs, it’s now my turn. I’m here to experience that joyous, dreamlike state for myself. The pack is strapped to my back, the jets to my arms, and I’m wearing ear defenders.</p> \n<p>There is a raised metal structure with a gantry. I’m trying to think about stepping up to play the main stage at Glastonbury rather than going to my own execution, which is what it feels much more like. The executioner is Browning’s assistant, Ryan, who attaches me to the hanging line. At the other end of it is a counterweight: I’m going to need all the help I can get. Then the jets are fired up. I tentatively squeeze the trigger under my right finger.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a549e0cbc6983704a3c673af8a6ec66f0359d9c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a549e0cbc6983704a3c673af8a6ec66f0359d9c/0_511_3840_4850/792.jpg\" alt=\"Chocks away ...

Wollaston achieves lift-off at Goodwood.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It’s a strange sensation, thrust coursing up through the arms. Browning, standing in front of me, indicates I should lean forward as if resting my weight on my arms and I can feel a reduction in weight … then spin around so that I’m facing the other way. After a few more attempts, my feet do just about leave the ground by a few centimetres, but it’s probably mostly Ryan pulling on the other end. Less Iron Man, more the Tin Man from Wizard of Oz. Still, one small step, as they say.</p> \n<p>Fine, I’ll take one, how much? They’re not really for sale, says Browning. “We have sold a couple, but only to people we have properly trained who wouldn’t let up about desperately wanting to own them.</p> \n<p>“And we still keep their suits, we never let any out of our sight. It’s like a Formula car – who sells a Formula One car? It’s too dangerous unless you know what you’re doing with it.”</p> \n<p>Go on, I’m not letting up, how much? The last one went for £340,000. Quite a lot for something you don’t even get to take home.</p> \n<p>Just how dangerous is it? “It is as risky as you choose to fly it,” says Browning. Unlike Zapata, who flies very high, Browning flies only a few metres off the ground, “as high as I would reluctantly accept falling from. So at worst a twisted ankle or a broken leg.” He has reached 85mph, though.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/29/jet-suit-paramedic-takes-lake-district-test-flight\">Jet suit paramedic takes Lake District test flight</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Things can go wrong, even on the ground. Up on the launch platform after me is a paying client, having his final attempt of the day at getting airborne. Suddenly there are flames coming from the jetpack, and for a scary couple of seconds it looks as if there might be an Icarus moment after all. But Ryan is on to it very swiftly with a fire extinguisher. Some kind of rear engine failure, they think, and will investigate.</p> \n<p>“In four years of doing this, that was the only time we’ve ever applied the fire extinguisher,” says Browning, who seems, for the first time, a tiny bit rattled.</p> \n<p>The client is fine, and remarkably unflustered, though he does admit: “Well, it’s not quite how I expected the day to finish.” I might hold my order and wait for the electric hover suit with the airbags. In the meantime, what about the other superpower, the only one that even comes close? “Funny you should say that, about the invisible thing,” says Browning. “I’ve actually got a plan about that.”</p>",

What is the point of it all? “The main thing, crass as it may sound, is entertainment.” Browning and his company Gravity Industries, now a multimillion-dollar organisation with investment from people such as the Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper, do flying displays at events – the opening of a baseball stadium in Japan, for example, or a car launch in China. They are planning a race series, though that has been put on hold by the pandemic. And they do training days here at Goodwood. At £6,000 a pop, the wealthy can come and have a go, albeit tied to a leash to prevent any unplanned Icarus incidents. He thinks the times – Covid, Brexit, Trump – have helped to fuel public interest, that it’s about “the metaphor of breaking free, being weightless and unbound, going for the skies and the stars. I don’t think people are consciously aware of that but I think it represents that.” Browning isn’t the only one taking to the skies. This year, someone with a jetpack flew around LAX airport in Los Angeles. Frenchman Franky Zapata crossed the Channel last year on his jet-powered hoverboard. And a US company, JetPack Aviation, boasts that it can fly a person to 15,000ft (4,600 metres). You might think the skies are soon going to fill up with people buzzing around, but (perhaps luckily for the environment) Browning says jetpacks are some way from becoming mainstream transport. “I never developed it with that in mind. I set out on this journey purely with the idea of having some fun with something that conventional wisdom said was impossible.” Remember, though, that the first motorcars were considered noisy, unreliable and dangerous – hugely inferior, technologically, to the horse. “I’m not running around telling everyone there’s going to be a revolution tomorrow,” Browning says. “We’re just going to enjoy the journey and see where it gets to.” Which isn’t to say he doesn’t hold out hope. “You can imagine, with safe and high-energy-density battery storage at 10 times what gasoline, diesel and jet fuel can do, an electric hover suit that can be automatically managed so it does not go more than three or four metres high and an airbag deployment system that makes it entirely safe, the equivalent of going for a bike ride.” It seems that practical applications may already be here. Browning says his company is talking with both the UK and US militaries. “I’ll say there is a very healthy collaboration. There is a niche special forces application. If you’ve got to get a human anywhere within a three or four kilometre radius of here, over minefields, through earthquake disaster zones, round forests, over rivers, I don’t care if it’s night or if there is a storm blowing, I can start up with the latest version of this in 10 seconds and be there.” Ambulance crews in the Lake District could soon be joined by jetsuit paramedics, after a recent trial showed they could reach an injured walker or climber in a fraction of the time that a traditional mountain rescue team would require. Andy Mawson of the Great North Air ambulance service, which ran the trial along with Gravity, tells me: “It’s amazing what you can do with a minimal set of equipment.” The 10 or 15kg of kit strapped to a flying paramedic’s front and legs could even include a lightweight defibrillator, along with airway-management equipment and a few drugs. “It’s not beyond feasibility that if there was a cardiac arrest on Helvellyn, we might be able to get a defib on that patient within eight minutes.” Mawson sees a situation where one paramedic operates from a car with a jetpack on board, somewhere central in the Lake District near the most popular fells, ready to go when the call comes in: leg fracture on Scafell Pike, perhaps. He makes the analogy of a city motorbike paramedic. A jetpack won’t take you to hospital, but it will get a trained person to your side quickly, to sort out breathing, blood flow or pain. He has already done a day’s training and the service is in serious discussions with Gravity about how to make the dream reality. “It’s a possibility we could see this late summer next year,” he says. Back in the marginally less challenging terrain of the South Downs, it’s now my turn. I’m here to experience that joyous, dreamlike state for myself. The pack is strapped to my back, the jets to my arms, and I’m wearing ear defenders. There is a raised metal structure with a gantry. I’m trying to think about stepping up to play the main stage at Glastonbury rather than going to my own execution, which is what it feels much more like. The executioner is Browning’s assistant, Ryan, who attaches me to the hanging line. At the other end of it is a counterweight: I’m going to need all the help I can get. Then the jets are fired up. I tentatively squeeze the trigger under my right finger. It’s a strange sensation, thrust coursing up through the arms. Browning, standing in front of me, indicates I should lean forward as if resting my weight on my arms and I can feel a reduction in weight … then spin around so that I’m facing the other way. After a few more attempts, my feet do just about leave the ground by a few centimetres, but it’s probably mostly Ryan pulling on the other end. Less Iron Man, more the Tin Man from Wizard of Oz. Still, one small step, as they say. Fine, I’ll take one, how much? They’re not really for sale, says Browning. “We have sold a couple, but only to people we have properly trained who wouldn’t let up about desperately wanting to own them. “And we still keep their suits, we never let any out of our sight. It’s like a Formula car – who sells a Formula One car? It’s too dangerous unless you know what you’re doing with it.” Go on, I’m not letting up, how much? The last one went for £340,000. Quite a lot for something you don’t even get to take home. Just how dangerous is it? “It is as risky as you choose to fly it,” says Browning. Unlike Zapata, who flies very high, Browning flies only a few metres off the ground, “as high as I would reluctantly accept falling from. So at worst a twisted ankle or a broken leg.” He has reached 85mph, though. Things can go wrong, even on the ground. Up on the launch platform after me is a paying client, having his final attempt of the day at getting airborne. Suddenly there are flames coming from the jetpack, and for a scary couple of seconds it looks as if there might be an Icarus moment after all. But Ryan is on to it very swiftly with a fire extinguisher. Some kind of rear engine failure, they think, and will investigate. “In four years of doing this, that was the only time we’ve ever applied the fire extinguisher,” says Browning, who seems, for the first time, a tiny bit rattled. The client is fine, and remarkably unflustered, though he does admit: “Well, it’s not quite how I expected the day to finish.” I might hold my order and wait for the electric hover suit with the airbags. In the meantime, what about the other superpower, the only one that even comes close? “Funny you should say that, about the invisible thing,” says Browning. “I’ve actually got a plan about that.”",

          "body": "<p>Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, is a mild-mannered software engineer who is not good at games of verbal fisticuffs with US politicians. He received a drubbing last month during the “big tech” congressional hearing.</p> <p>Pichai can, however, summon lawyers and lobbyists galore as soon as the game gets more serious, which it definitely has. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) last week launched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/21/google-antitrust-charges-what-is-next\" title=\"\">a huge and historic antitrust case against Google</a>, accusing the tech company of abusing its position to maintain an illegal monopoly over internet searches and search advertising.</p> <p>In response, Kent Walker, Google’s chief lawyer, published <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/response-doj/\" title=\"\">an indignant blogpost</a> that signalled how the firm will fight this. Google will claim it – and not the DoJ – is on the side of the American people and, by extension, people across the world.</p> <p>“People use Google because they choose to, not because they’re forced to, or because they can’t find alternatives,” wrote Walker. “This lawsuit would do nothing to help consumers. To the contrary, it would artificially prop up lower-quality search alternatives, raise phone prices, and make it harder for people to get the search services they want to use”.</p> <p>This argument has superficial appeal. Google doesn’t charge users and can’t stop them using rivals’ products. In a neat touch, Walker included instructions on how to load Microsoft’s Bing search engine on an Android phone.</p> <p>As for those multibillion payments to Apple to get Google pre-loaded on iPhones and iPads – one of the DoJ’s main complaints – Walker said they are like the promotional fees a cereal brand might pay a supermarket to stock its products at eye level. Other search engines are free to negotiate space on the digital shelf or home screen, he argued, and this is how software has always been distributed.</p> <p>Convinced? You shouldn’t be. There are four reasons, at least, why the DoJ is right to fight this case. First, a product that is free (or free at the point of use) can still cause harm to consumers. The process is just indirect. An overly dominant search engine can, for example, raise its prices to advertisers, who then recoup the extra expense by charging more for hotels, flights, electronic gadgets, books, insurance, and so on.</p> <p>Second, Google’s cereal comparison doesn’t work. A key point about a dominant search engine is that it can gather more data to enhance the offer and thereby achieve greater competitive clout. It has a self-reinforcing aspect that doesn’t apply in the non-data world of cornflakes and Coco Pops.</p> <p>Third, most users don’t change their default settings. Yes, it’s technically simple to do, but most people don’t. That is why Google is happy to pay Apple a fortune every year for default status – it can be extremely confident of a return on that investment, knowing no rival can match its spending power.</p> <p>Fourth, there is the deep problem of Google’s sheer size and effective control of 80% of the search market. How could new ideas and approaches ever get a look-in?</p> <p>“If we let Google continue its anti-competitive ways, we will lose the next wave of innovators and Americans may never get to benefit from the ‘next Google’,” said William Barr, the US attorney-general.</p> <p>In that final respect, this case is similar to celebrated antitrust challenges of the past – Standard Oil, AT&amp;T and Microsoft. It’s about confronting corporate power when it becomes the gatekeeper to an industry, the lawsuit’s description of Google’s position in search.</p> <p>Pichai’s usual plea on that point is that “Google’s continued success is not guaranteed”. And that can be rubbished for a simple reason: it is easy to see how the gates would clang shut on any competitor that became truly threatening.</p> <p>Good luck to the DoJ – this is an important 21st-century case.</p> <h2>Johnson’s plans for British industry are full of wind</h2> <p>Next week, Boris Johnson is expected to deliver a 10-point plan outlining the government’s green <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/industrial-policy\" title=\"\">industrial strategy</a> before it publishes a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/21/uk-plans-to-bring-forward-ban-on-fossil-fuel-vehicles-to-2030\" title=\"\">long-delayed energy white paper</a>, possibly in November. A fresh strategy paper is a chance for the PM to persuade the electorate that while his character may not be well suited to fighting a pandemic, he knows how to strike an upbeat note when the subject turns to major building projects.</p> <p>It might have taken him six years as London mayor before he could see cycle superhighways being built across London, but they did happen, and they played a part in transforming the infrastructure of the capital. When he wanted a cable car across the Thames, it arrived and worked, to many people’s amazement.</p> <p>Unfortunately what you cannot say is that any of the prime minister’s achievements so far are glued together as part of a strategy. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/24/mps-to-check-if-the-governments-green-plans-are-fit-for-purpose\" title=\"\">They can at best be described as ad hoc</a>, and sit alongside schemes that detract from the central message, if that message is about the climate emergency and carbon emissions.</p> <p>At this year’s Conservative party conference, Johnson said a green industrial revolution would repair the economy following the pandemic. This month, he repeated a pledge that every home in the UK would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/05/boris-johnson-to-unveil-plan-to-power-all-uk-homes-with-wind-by-2030\" title=\"\">powered by wind energy</a> within 10 years, at a cost of £160bn.</p> <p>These are laudable aims and show Johnson has been gathering his thoughts.

          "bodyText": "Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, is a mild-mannered software engineer who is not good at games of verbal fisticuffs with US politicians. He received a drubbing last month during the “big tech” congressional hearing. Pichai can, however, summon lawyers and lobbyists galore as soon as the game gets more serious, which it definitely has. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) last week launched a huge and historic antitrust case against Google, accusing the tech company of abusing its position to maintain an illegal monopoly over internet searches and search advertising. In response, Kent Walker, Google’s chief lawyer, published an indignant blogpost that signalled how the firm will fight this. Google will claim it – and not the DoJ – is on the side of the American people and, by extension, people across the world. “People use Google because they choose to, not because they’re forced to, or because they can’t find alternatives,” wrote Walker. “This lawsuit would do nothing to help consumers. To the contrary, it would artificially prop up lower-quality search alternatives, raise phone prices, and make it harder for people to get the search services they want to use”. This argument has superficial appeal. Google doesn’t charge users and can’t stop them using rivals’ products. In a neat touch, Walker included instructions on how to load Microsoft’s Bing search engine on an Android phone. As for those multibillion payments to Apple to get Google pre-loaded on iPhones and iPads – one of the DoJ’s main complaints – Walker said they are like the promotional fees a cereal brand might pay a supermarket to stock its products at eye level. Other search engines are free to negotiate space on the digital shelf or home screen, he argued, and this is how software has always been distributed. Convinced? You shouldn’t be. There are four reasons, at least, why the DoJ is right to fight this case. First, a product that is free (or free at the point of use) can still cause harm to consumers. The process is just indirect. An overly dominant search engine can, for example, raise its prices to advertisers, who then recoup the extra expense by charging more for hotels, flights, electronic gadgets, books, insurance, and so on. Second, Google’s cereal comparison doesn’t work. A key point about a dominant search engine is that it can gather more data to enhance the offer and thereby achieve greater competitive clout. It has a self-reinforcing aspect that doesn’t apply in the non-data world of cornflakes and Coco Pops. Third, most users don’t change their default settings. Yes, it’s technically simple to do, but most people don’t. That is why Google is happy to pay Apple a fortune every year for default status – it can be extremely confident of a return on that investment, knowing no rival can match its spending power. Fourth, there is the deep problem of Google’s sheer size and effective control of 80% of the search market. How could new ideas and approaches ever get a look-in? “If we let Google continue its anti-competitive ways, we will lose the next wave of innovators and Americans may never get to benefit from the ‘next Google’,” said William Barr, the US attorney-general. In that final respect, this case is similar to celebrated antitrust challenges of the past – Standard Oil, AT&amp;T and Microsoft. It’s about confronting corporate power when it becomes the gatekeeper to an industry, the lawsuit’s description of Google’s position in search. Pichai’s usual plea on that point is that “Google’s continued success is not guaranteed”. And that can be rubbished for a simple reason: it is easy to see how the gates would clang shut on any competitor that became truly threatening. Good luck to the DoJ – this is an important 21st-century case. Johnson’s plans for British industry are full of wind Next week, Boris Johnson is expected to deliver a 10-point plan outlining the government’s green industrial strategy before it publishes a long-delayed energy white paper, possibly in November. A fresh strategy paper is a chance for the PM to persuade the electorate that while his character may not be well suited to fighting a pandemic, he knows how to strike an upbeat note when the subject turns to major building projects. It might have taken him six years as London mayor before he could see cycle superhighways being built across London, but they did happen, and they played a part in transforming the infrastructure of the capital. When he wanted a cable car across the Thames, it arrived and worked, to many people’s amazement. Unfortunately what you cannot say is that any of the prime minister’s achievements so far are glued together as part of a strategy. They can at best be described as ad hoc, and sit alongside schemes that detract from the central message, if that message is about the climate emergency and carbon emissions. At this year’s Conservative party conference, Johnson said a green industrial revolution would repair the economy following the pandemic. This month, he repeated a pledge that every home in the UK would be powered by wind energy within 10 years, at a cost of £160bn. These are laudable aims and show Johnson has been gathering his thoughts. But the manufacturing industry that might have played a big part in building wind turbines was destroyed by previous Tory governments. Now Johnson wants to add a no-deal or limited-deal Brexit that will undermine the rest of the UK’s industrial base. Britain needs a strategy in many areas. Let’s hope the PM has coordinated a plan across all departments that can rightfully be called a green industrial strategy. The ticket king’s bid for Viagogo could be about to stall The $4bn (£3bn) takeover of ticket resale website StubHub by its rival Viagogo had already been dubbed the “worst deal in history”, having been finalised weeks before the pandemic shut down live events indefinitely. Viagogo boss Eric Baker founded both firms and his dream is to preside as ticket king over a reunited empire. Perhaps blinded by that ambition, he dismissed Covid-19 as a flash in the pan and pressed on with the deal, spending some of his own considerable resources – together with those of financial backers including the mega-rich Waltons, the family behind Walmart. As ill-timed as the takeover looked a few weeks ago, it looks even worse now that the UK competition watchdog has signalled its intention to block it. The CMA understandably balked at the idea of a tie-up that would give the combined company 90% of the UK ticket resale market. What now for Viagogo? It’s main target in buying StubHub is the US market, where its rival dominates. Yet the British regulator threatens to scupper everything. If Baker offers to shut down StubHub UK, Viagogo would hoover up its rival’s business anyway, creating a monopoly via a different route. The CMA surely could not allow that. A partial sale of StubHub, a web-based company whose strength is its platform, is impractical to the point of impossibility. The CMA may ultimately force Viagogo to sell StubHub, appointing a divestiture trustee to seek a buyer. That trustee would have no obligation to recoup Baker’s $4bn. That’s not the most remarkable thing, though. Part of the CMA’s remit will be, unwittingly, to look out for the interests of professional resellers, the touts who dominate resale listings. As the Observer has shown, many “resellers” use the same methods that saw super-touts Peter Hunter and David Smith jailed last year for fraud. So the CMA may find itself accidentally defending the interests of fraudsters who make a living scamming the public. It seems anything is possible in 2020.",

          "bodyText": "As campaigning victories go, forcing Mark Zuckerberg’s social media empire to admit a discriminatory flaw in its policy is no small feat. But following a campaign launched in this paper, the Observer can exclusively reveal that Instagram and its parent company Facebook will be updating its policy on nudity in order to help end discrimination of plus-size black women on its platforms and ensure all body types are treated fairly. In August, Instagram was accused of censoring and silencing the plus-size model Nyome Nicholas-Williams. A wave of content creators then confirmed the platform was repeatedly discriminating against black people, plus-size users and other marginalised communities, by deleting their photos or failing to promote them in the same way it did for its white users. Speaking to the Observer over the summer, Nicholas-Williams and photographer Alexandra Cameron told of how photos from their “confidence shoot” were repeatedly deleted and taken down, with warnings that their accounts – which have more than 115,000 followers between them – could be closed down. The controversy caused fans to protest and post pictures of the model en masse under the hashtag #IWantToSeeNyome. The photo-sharing app owned by Facebook was accused of hypocrisy and racism in allowing an abundance of photos of semi-naked skinny white women on its feeds but deleting those posted by black women in similar poses. Nicholas-Williams said she was shocked that “a fat black woman celebrating her body is banned … I want to promote self-love and inclusivity because that’s how I feel and how I want other women like me to feel”. The photos in question showed Nicholas-Williams with her eyes closed and wrapping an arm around her breasts. While the pose is a common trope across social media, in this instance it was deemed to violate Instagram’s guidance on pornography. As well as sophisticated artificial intelligence, Facebook and Instagram employ 15,000 content reviewers across the world. These workers individually sift through thousands of photos that are reported as offensive by users to the app everyday. Human bias – unconscious or otherwise – might be expected to occur in content deletion and account bans but Facebook and Instagram have exhaustive rules that must be applied to allow either to happen. The company denied Nicholas-Williams had been racially discriminated against, but confirmed that its former policy on “boob squeezing” had caused her photos to be removed. Campaigner Gina Martin, who had also lobbied Instagram and who previously got the law changed to criminalise “upskirting” in 2018,said: “This policy change is an example of what happens when you recognise an issue, get organised, form a relationship with big platforms and make yourself difficult to ignore.” Nicholas-Williams said she was delighted with the outcome. “This is a huge step and I am glad a dialogue has now been opened,” she said. “I want to ensure that I am respected and allowed to use spaces like Instagram, as many other creators do, without the worry of being censored and silenced.” Instagram’s influence on trends and popular culture cannot be underestimated.
